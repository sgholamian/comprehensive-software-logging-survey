However, the ill-structured and open-ended nature of engineering design makes it difficult for an instructor to keep track of the design processes of all students simultaneously and provide personalized feedback on a timely basis. This study proposes a Bayesian network model to dynamically and automatically assess students’ engagement with engineering design tasks and to support formative feedback. Specifically, we applied a Bayesian network to 111 ninth-grade students’ process data logged by a computer-aided design software program that students used to solve an engineering design challenge. Evidence was extracted from the log files and fed into the Bayesian network to perform inferential reasoning and provide a barometer of their performance in the form of posterior probabilities. Results showed that the Bayesian network model was competent at predicting a student’s task performance. It performed well in both identifying students of a particular group (recall) and ensuring identified students were correctly labeled (precision). This study also suggests that Bayesian networks can be used to pinpoint a student’s strengths and weaknesses for applying relevant science knowledge to engineering design tasks. Future work of implementing this tool within the computer-aided design software will provide instructors a powerful tool to facilitate engineering design through automatically generating personalized feedback to students in real time.},

	abstract = {Aim
              The prognostic significance of perineural invasion (PNI) in oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is unclear. We examined the association of PNI with clinical outcomes in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) and surgery.
            
            
              Methods
              We performed a single institutional retrospective study. We evaluated the association of PNI with locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival using log-rank and Cox proportional hazard modelling.
            
            
              Results
              29 out of 73 patients (40\%) had PNI at the time of surgery. The median follow-up was 20.1 months. The median DFS was 18.4 months for patients with PNI vs 41.3 months for patients without PNI (p{\textless}0.05). The median LRFS was 23.3 months for patients with PNI and median not reached for patients without PNI (p{\textless}0.01). In a multivariate model including age and pathological variables, PNI remained a significant independent predictor of LRFS (HR 0.20, 95\% CI 0.07 to 0.60; p=0.004).
            
            
              Conclusions
              For patients with EAC treated with nCRT, PNI found at the time of surgery is significantly associated with worse LRFS. Our data support attempts to validate this finding and perhaps testing the role of adjuvant therapy in patients with PNI.},

	abstract = {Objective:
              mHealth interventions often favour individual-level effects. This is particularly problematic in contexts where social support and shifts in social norms are critical to sustained behaviour change. Mobile digital games represent a promising health education strategy for youth, including in low-resource settings. We sought to better understand the interpersonal and social interactions that can be elicited by digital games for health.
            
            
              Design:
              We piloted Tumaini, a smartphone game rooted in interactive narrative designed to prevent HIV among young Africans (aged 11–14), in a randomised controlled feasibility study and analysed reports of the household dynamics surrounding gameplay. Following a 16-day intervention period, phone gameplay log files were downloaded, and intervention arm participants ( n = 30) completed a gameplay experience survey; eight focus group discussions were held, four with intervention arm participants ( n = 27) and four with their parents ( n = 22).
            
            
              Setting:
              This study took place in Kisumu, Kenya, in Spring 2017.
            
            
              Method:
              Descriptive statistics were computed from survey responses and log files. Focus group transcripts were labelled, analysed thematically and compared demographically using MAXQDA software.
            
            
              Results:
              Data from log files, surveys and focus groups indicate that the game generated considerable interaction and dialogue with parents, siblings and friends and served as a catalyst for children to act as advocates for healthful decisions about sex, both within the family and beyond. The game showed a high level of acceptability with parents.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              Serious digital games using a smartphone platform can generate considerable household interaction. Games can model and facilitate these exchanges, maximising multi-level effects. An additional app for parents could reinforce these effects.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The development of unmanned aerial vehicles has been identified as a potential source of a weapon for causing operational disruptions against critical infrastructures. To mitigate and neutralise the threat posed by the misuse of drones against malicious and terrorist activity, this paper presents a holistic design of a long-range autonomous drone detection platform. The novelty of the proposed system lies in the confluence between the design of hardware and software components to effective and efficient localisation of the intruder objects. The research presented in the paper proposes the design and validation of a situation awareness component which is interfaced with the hardware component for controlling the focal length of the camera. The continuous stream of media data obtained from the region of vulnerability is processed using the object detection that is built on region based fully connected neural network. The novelty of the proposed system relies on the processing of multi-threaded dual-media input streams that are evaluated to mitigate the latency of the system. Upon the successful detection of malicious drones, the system logs the occurrence of intruders that consists of both event description and the associated media evidence for the deployment of the mitigation strategy. The analytics platform that controls the signalling of the low-cost sensing equipment contains the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 for detecting drones. The experimental testbeds developed for the validation of the proposed system has been constructed to include environments and situations that are commonly faced by critical infrastructure operators such as the area of protection, drone flight path, tradeoff between the angle of coverage against the distance of coverage. The validation of the proposed system has resulted in yielding a range of intruder drone detection by 250m with an accuracy of 95.5\%.},

	abstract = {In recent years, sensors in the Internet of things have been commonly used in Human’s life. APT (Advanced Persistent Threats) has caused serious damage to network security and the sensors play an important role in the attack process. For a long time, attackers infiltrate, attack, conceal, spread, and steal information of target groups through the compound use of various attacking means, while existing security measures based on single-time nodes cannot defend against such attacks. Attackers often exploit the sensors’ vulnerabilities to attack targets because the security level of the sensors is relatively low when compared with that of the host. We can find APT attacks by checking the suspicious domains generated at different APT attack stages, since every APT attack has to use DNS to communicate. Although this method works, two challenges still exist: (1) the detection method needs to check a large scale of log data; (2) the small number of attacking samples limits conventional supervised learning. This paper proposes an APT detection framework AULD (Advanced Persistent Threats Unsupervised Learning Detection) to detect suspicious domains in APT attacks by using unsupervised learning. We extract ten important features from the host, domain name, and time from a large number of DNS log data. Later, we get the suspicious cluster by performing unsupervised learning. We put all of the domains in the cluster into the list of malicious domains. We collected 1,584,225,274 DNS records from our university network. The experiments show that AULD detected all of the attacking samples and that AULD can effectively detect the suspicious domain names in APT attacks.},

              Background
              Vascular calcification is a prominent feature in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes mellitus. A recent report suggests that angiotensin II is protective to vascular calcification. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between vascular calcification and use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and/or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) from a cross-sectional view.
            
            
              Methods
              
                A total of 121 predialysis CKD patients (age 71 ± 12 y; male 72; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 20.2 (11.8 - 40.3) mL/min/1.73 m
                2
                ) who underwent thoracoabdominal plain computed tomography scan were included in this study. The total vascular calcification volume (Calc) was calculated with a three-dimensional imaging software and standardized by body surface area (BSA). The relevance between log [Calc/BSA] and ACEI/ARB use was investigated by multivariate linear regression analyses with or without a time-duration factor of ACEI/ARB use.

                The Calc/BSA was 5.62 (2.01 - 12.7) mL/m
                2
                in 121 patients. In multivariate analyses adjusted with age, sex, ACEI/ARB and log [eGFR], ACEI/ARB use is significantly and positively associated with log [Calc/BSA] (β = 0.2781,
                p
                 = 0.0007). Even after the adjustment by age, sex, log [eGFR], phosphate, diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure, warfarin, hypertension, dyslipidemia, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diuretics and ACEI/ARB, ACEI/ARB use is significantly and positively associated with log [Calc/BSA] (β = 0.1677,
                p
                 = 0.0487). When 90 patients whose time-duration of ACEI/ARB use was clear in medical records were studied, a multivariate analysis adjusted with age, sex, log [eGFR], and ACEI/ARB duration factors showed that the longer use of ACEI/ARB more than 2 years was significantly, independently and positively associated with log [Calc/BSA] (β = 0.2864,
                p
                 = 0.0060).
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              ACEI/ARB user was associated with vascular calcification in predialysis patients with low eGFR. Prospective studies with larger numbers of patients or more in vitro studies are needed to confirm whether this phenomenon is due to the use of ACEI/ARB itself, the underlying disease condition or the prescription bias.},

            Multi-stage hydraulic fracturing has gained popularity all over the world as more tight geologic formations are developed economically for hydrocarbon resources. However, due to the stages' operating complexity, different kinds of disruptions in fracturing operations may occur and even result in great economic loss. Screenout is one of the issues caused by the blockage of proppant inside the fractures. This paper presents a screenout classification system based on Gaussian Hidden Markov Models (GHMMs), trained on simulated data, that predicts screenouts and provides early warning by learning pre-screenout patterns in the simulated surface pressure signals. The simulated data are generated in a hydraulic fracturing software using a horizontal well with three fracturing stages landing in the Niobrara B shale, Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin. During the 270 simulations, various synthetic fracturing treatment data are forward modeled for both screenout and non-screenout scenarios. The classification system consists of two Gaussian Hidden Markov Models (screenout and non-screenout), each of which is fitted and optimized by its respective training set. Both Hidden Markov Models are assigned with two 1D Gaussian probability density functions to represent the distribution of their associated simulated surface pressure signals. During the classification process, once a new surface pressure sequence is observed, the maximum log likelihood is calculated under both fitted models and the model with a greater likelihood will be predicted as the class of this new observation. The classification system is validated with a hold-out testing data set from the simulations and the statistics of the performance is visualized in a confusion matrix. The results indicate the classification system achieves an overall classification accuracy of 81\% and an accuracy of 86\% for successfully predicting screenout events around 8.5 minutes prior to screenout occurring in the simulation. The described methodology is demonstrated to be a useful tool for early screenout detection and shows its promising feasibility of other fracturing time-series data analysis.},

            The unconventional Shale and Tight play concept has grown to dominate the North American energy landscape, now accounting for the vast majority of onshore activity levels. However, not all Shale or Tight reservoir plays are created equal and what works for one play/Formation may not work for another. How should you design your stimulation, where to begin, what parameters are most impactful and what are some of the large economic leavers that can either make your project successful, or potentially cause it to fail.
            The Duvernay is an Upper Devonian mudrock, with significant quartz, carbonate and total organic carbon content, making it an attractive Shale gas target. Total Organic Carbon (TOC) varies from 2-17 wt.\% and porosity ranges from 3-8\% (averaging approximately 5\%). The Formation is approximately 2,800 – 3,800 meters deep in the project area and is approximately 35-60m thick. Importantly, the target is significantly overpressured, with nearly double normal hydrostatic reservoir pressure (15-21 Kpa/m gradient). The native permeability of the Duvernay Formation is extremely tight, measuring in the 70-150 nano Darcy range, thus the formation requires horizontal wells with multi stage hydraulic fracturing, to be economically productive. The natural fracture density of the formation partially explains how a rock with such low matrix permeability can be so prolific, background tectonic fracturing is significantly greater than most other low permeability reservoirs being exploited in North America. Fracture densities have been measured in core and image logs at up to 8 fractures per meter, with average open fracture density's approximating 1-2 per meter. These fractures are steeply dipping (75-85 degrees) and created during tectonic events, both open and healed/calcite filled fractures are present. While the presence of natural fractures aid in the productive stage of the well's life, it can complicate the stimulation design and challenge the placement of a wellbore treatment.
            During the initial planning stages of an unconventional hydraulic stimulation program, the first step is to examine what other operators in the play are already utilizing. Early due diligence into what design elements are successful and almost as important, not successful, can save significant amounts of capital early in the evolution of a project. An example of this within the Duvernay project were uncemented ball drop liner completion systems. Due to the high-pressure pumping requirements of the Duvernay (up to 90 Mpa), these systems were not able to adequately stimulate the reservoir and were prone to install and isolation challenges. Limited entry Plug and Perf design dominates the Canadian unconventional energy landscape, this is where Chevron Canada Limited and KUFPEC Canada ("The JV") began its journey. The next critical stimulation parameters to decide on are proppant and water intensities, these will govern the duration of the stimulation and are key economic drivers (proppant intensity is typically the most significant variable in terms of cost and well productivity). Other major inputs into the frac program center around cluster design; number of clusters to be treated as part of a single frac stage, the spacing between the clusters and the number and orientation of perforations within a cluster/stage are key parameters. The treatment pressure is usually dictated by the breakdown and fracture extension pressure inherent to the reservoir, where the target treatment rate is a selection made by the operator (typically 10-15 m3/min for most unconventional reservoirs). Stimulation fluid design also varies by play type, Slickwater designs are some of the most popular in use today with hybrids, reverse hybrids and high viscosity friction reducer (VFR), also used in various quantities across play types. Connected to the stimulation design, is the interwell spacing distance, usually the wider wells are spaced from one another, the higher the proppant intensity. The key premise of limited entry design assumes that all the clusters within a fracture stage are taking fluid and sand equally and thus, have equal fracture half lengths, this is not the case (concept known as cluster efficiency), more discussion on that topic to follow later in the manuscript.},

However, such assessments do not ensure valid evaluation because the same GNSS signal environment cannot be ensured in a different test session irrespective of how accurately it mimics the original session. In this study, we propose a valid methodology that can evaluate the dynamic performance of multiple GNSS receivers in various positioning modes with only one dynamic test. We used the record-and-replay function of RACELOGIC’s LabSat3 Wideband and developed a software that can log and re-broadcast Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM) messages for the augmented systems. A preliminary static test and a drone test were performed to verify proper operation of the system. The results show that the system could efficiently evaluate the performances of stand-alone, differential GNSS, and real time kinematics positioning for three GNSS receivers in two different positioning modes by repeatedly re-radiating the recorded signals acquired through only one flight. Our proposed system is expected to be useful in evaluating dynamic navigation performance accurately and conveniently in a valid manner.},

	abstract = {The present work arose from problems occurred during the revamp of a pipeline SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system at the beginning of 2012, when occurred some unexpected system crashes that could interrupt the operation of the second major Brazilian pipeline maritime terminal.
            Before a system breakdown, we observed some signs, like fail-overs in the event log files. If the development and maintenance crews were aware of these events not only the problem causes could be better understood, but also the imminent crash could have been avoided. A faster and autonomous way for the system communicates its problems was necessary.
            ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System) — a part of an autonomous communication system, which reports aircraft condition for a system on the ground, through satellite links and short messages — inspired us to develop an Internet of Things (IoT) system, using text messages (SMS, short message service) of the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM).
            Autonomous and short text messages are the keywords that drove our work, and the solution came through a text message gateway — the solution to get information in advance.
            This presentation will discuss the idea, hardware and software components, message format, applications and future perspectives.},

Sahib, N. G., Tombros, A., \& Stockman, T. (2012). A comparative analysis of the information-seeking behavior of visually impaired and sighted searchers. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 63(2), 377–391. doi: 10.1002/asi.21696

Objective – To determine how the behaviour of visually impaired persons significantly differs from that of sighted persons in the carrying out of complex search tasks on the internet.

Design – A comparative observational user study, plus semi-structured interviews.

Setting – Not specified.

Subjects – 15 sighted and 15 visually impaired persons, all of them experienced and frequent Internet search engine users, of both sexes and varying in age from early 
twenties to mid-fifties.


Methods – The subjects carried out self-selected complex search tasks on their own equipment and in their own familiar environments. The investigators observed this activity to some extent directly, but for the most part via video camera, through use of a screen-sharing facility, or with screen-capture software. They distinguished four stages of search task activity: query formulation, search results exploration, query reformulation, and search results management. The visually impaired participants, of whom 13 were totally blind and two had only marginal vision, were all working with text-to-speech screen readers and depended exclusively for all their observed activity on those applications’ auditory output. For data analysis, the investigators devised a grounded-theory-based coding scheme. They employed a search log format for deriving further quantitative data which they later controlled for statistical significance (two-tailed unpaired t-test; p {\textless} 0.05). The interviews allowed them to document, in particular, how the visually impaired subjects themselves subsequently accounted for, interpreted, and vindicated various observed aspects of their searching behaviour.

Main Results – The investigators found significant differences between the sighted participants’ search behaviour and that of the visually impaired searchers. The latter displayed a clearly less “orienteering” (O'Day \& Jeffries, 1993) disposition and style, more often starting out with already relatively long and comprehensive combinations of relatively precise search terms; “their queries were more expressive” (p. 386). They submitted fewer follow-up queries, and were considerably less inclined to attempt query reformulation. They were aiming to achieve a satisfactory search outcome in a single step. Nevertheless, they rarely employed advanced operators, and made far less use (in only 4 instances) of their search engine’s query-support features than did the sighted searchers (37 instances). Fewer of them (13\%) ventured beyond the first page of the results returned for their query by the search engine than was the case among the sighted searchers (43\%). They viewed fewer (a mean of 4.27, as opposed to 13.40) retrieved pages, and they visited fewer external links (6 visits by 4 visually impaired searchers, compared with 34 visits by 11 sighted searchers). The visually impaired participants more frequently engaged in note taking than did the sighted participants.

The visually impaired searchers were in some cases, the investigators discovered, unaware of search engine facilities or searching tactics which might have improved their search outcomes. Yet even when they were aware of these, they very often chose not to employ them because doing so via their screen readers would have cost them more time and effort than they were willing to expend. In general, they were more diffident and less resourceful than the sighted searchers, and had more trust in the innate capacity and reliability of their search engine to return in an efficient manner the best available results.

Conclusion – Despite certain inherent limitations of the present study (the relatively small sample sizes and the non-randomness of the purposive sighted-searcher sample, the possible presence of extraneous variables, the impossibility of entirely ruling out familiarity bias), its findings strongly support the conclusion that working with today’s search engine user interfaces through the intermediation of currently available assistive technologies necessarily imposes severe limits on the degree to which visually impaired persons can efficiently search the web for information relevant to their needs. The findings furthermore suggest that there are various measures that it would be possible to take toward alleviating the situation, in the form of further improvements to retrieval systems, to search interfaces, and to text-to-speech screen readers. Such improvements would include:

•	more accessible system hints to support a better, and less cognitively intensive, query formulation;
•	web page layouts which are more suitable to screen-reader intermediation;
•	a results presentation which more readily facilitates browsing and exploratory behaviour, preferably including auditory previews and overviews;
•	presentation formats which allow for quicker and more accurate relevance judgments;
•	mechanisms for (a better) monitoring of search progress.

In any event, further information behaviour studies ought now to be conducted, with the specific aim of more closely informing the development of user interfaces which will offer the kind of support that visually impaired Internet searchers are most in need of. Success in this undertaking will ultimately contribute to the further empowerment of visually disabled persons and thereby facilitate efforts to combat social exclusion.},

In this issue of Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, Katz and coauthors demonstrate that this device was more accurate and quicker in detecting abnormal glucose patterns than the review by HCPs of 30-day handwritten BG logs and that its interpretations were positively accepted by the HCPs.

              To probe into the pattern in which the excavation and loading process have on such factors as stress and displacement in neighboring regions of deep open pits, a mechanical unloading model in coal mining process and another model for the loading process are set up respectively. Besides, FLAC

              software is used to simulate dynamic excavating and loading process in open pits and record such data as the unbalanced stress, unloading strength and displacement fluctuations, which further serve as basis for studying the functional relationship about different mining heights and scope of influence using fitting method. The research results indicate that the unloading strength enhances with increasing mining depth in a linear fashion. In addition, a noticeable displacement circle takes shape around the stope, which would also extends with growing mining depth. As to waste loading, it brings about large-scale surface subsidence in neighboring regions, which follows a logarithm function convergence pattern with the distance away from the dump border. Under combined effects of excavation and loading, the value of the soil mass displacement would increase with growing mining depth and loading height. Specifically, the soil displacement at a distance of 100 m away from the stope border (around 200 m away from the outer dump border) is abnormally significant and it further develops at a rate of 0.0228 mm/h.},

This study analyzes system logs collected from the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to capture user engagement over time. We measured engagement through mapping event logs with three components of engagement. We further analyzed the helpfulness of engagement measurement in predicting grades. The results showed that there was a significant and moderate positive correlation between the behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement and quiz scores. A multiple linear regression analysis also showed that higher behavioral and cognitive engagement were related to higher quiz scores. Thus, this study performed three classification methods and found that the ANN method got the highest accuracy. This study applied sequential analysis to discover the difference between video watching behavior of the high and low quiz scores students. The results indicate that it is important to take into account all of the behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement in understanding user engagement during the system development process.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              – This paper aims to analyze the intersection of LibGuide authors (producers) and LibGuide users (consumers) at University Library, Cornell University, New York, USA. In consideration of this previous finding, the authors felt it was vital to address the question of how Cornell University Library (CUL) LibGuides can better serve Cornell’s user base. By posing questions such as, “what are authors’ intentions in creating LibGuides” and “how are local users finding, accessing and/or engaging with LibGuides”, this paper hopes to make nuanced recommendations to authors.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              – This paper addresses two key pieces of data: browser search terms from the Springshare log files and interviews from authors of 20 different LibGuides. The author interviews gave us insight into the purpose, use and marketing of specific library guides for CUL, while browser search terms revealed how our users constructed Internet searches that resulted in that hit on a CUL LibGuide.
            
            
              Findings
              – Data uncovered in our analysis of affiliated search terms provide great insight into users’ expectations or perception of what they are seeking: 39 per cent of searches performed by affiliated users contained terminology of either the name of the course, the four-digit letter-number code for the course (e.g. ANTH 2300), the name of the professor and the course or some other similar permutation. This suggests that the LibGuides software needs a better way to index institutional courses by number and name, a finding the authors will return to later.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              – As LibGuides are ephemeral and constantly changing, rather than creating a LibGuides based on the premise of its purpose – course guide, subject guide or other – perhaps, authors should consider how the LibGuide will live online and specifically, what is its life cycle? The longevity of a LibGuide ensures that it will be discovered in some way or another; however, the discovery of outdated material is not the best introduction to these vehicles of information. If LibGuides aim to serve as an unmediated stand-in for librarians, its online life expectancy needs to be considered at the point of creation.
            
            
              Practical implications
              – Recommendations for LibGuide authors/producers: place most important content in the first tab (over 50 per cent of hits are to the homepage); minimize the total number of tabs. Fewer tabs are likely to encourage more in-depth browsing and facilitate better discovery of key content; include interactive content in LibGuides, such as assignments and tutorials that increase the use of that LibGuide; identify LibGuides and/or tabs in terms of function – teaching or discovery – within a search environment.
            
            
              Social implications
              – The tension between LibGuides as a teaching tool and LibGuides as an answer to a student’s research is an issue that we should resolve to fix. This tension is often eased in classroom instruction or during mediated interactions at the reference desk or via chat reference. However, in the online environment of LibGuides, librarians must be cognizant that students will often not be seeking the instruction on locating resources but rather will focus on simply locating the resource itself. Course guides might be better served online by pushing the instructional components toward the final tabs and relocating the valuable resource content to the Home tab. Promoting the use of library guides beyond the classroom or the event that they were designed for may not be necessary or desirable; however, as LibGuides have a lengthy life cycle, consideration about how they might meet a user’s online needs is worthwhile.
            
            
              Originality/value
              – This paper offers a unique perspective in the use of a common library tool from two points of view: the producers and the consumers of library guides. Too often, people take for granted the idea that they know and understand what librarians and/or library staff do and intend with the creation of LibGuides, without informing our perspective with actual data. The authors realize that the sample size of their interviewee pool was small, but nonetheless, deemed it an essential aspect to consider when evaluating the interaction of library guides or other library content put forth for the constituents we serve. In terms of user research, the authors are in a privileged position given the quantity of attention directed at the consumers of library guides; this study contributes to the conversation by highlighting the rare access people have to the results of unmediated user practices in the information gathering process.},

              BACKGROUND
              Urinary concentrations of creatine and guanidinoacetic acid divided by creatinine are informative markers for cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes (CDSs). The renal excretion of these substances varies substantially with age and sex, challenging the sensitivity and specificity of postanalytical interpretation.
            
            
              METHODS
              Results from 155 patients with CDS and 12 507 reference individuals were contributed by 5 diagnostic laboratories. They were binned into 104 adjacent age intervals and renormalized with Box–Cox transforms (Ξ). Estimates for central tendency (μ) and dispersion (σ) of Ξ were obtained for each bin. Polynomial regression analysis was used to establish the age dependence of both μ[log(age)] and σ[log(age)]. The regression residuals were then calculated as z-scores = \{Ξ − μ[log(age)]\}/σ[log(age)]. The process was iterated until all z-scores outside Tukey fences ±3.372 were identified and removed. Continuous percentile charts were then calculated and plotted by retransformation.
            
            
              RESULTS
              Statistically significant and biologically relevant subgroups of z-scores were identified. Significantly higher marker values were seen in females than males, necessitating separate reference intervals in both adolescents and adults. Comparison between our reconstructed reference percentiles and current standard age-matched reference intervals highlights an underlying risk of false-positive and false-negative events at certain ages.
            
            
              CONCLUSIONS
              Disease markers depending strongly on covariates such as age and sex require large numbers of reference individuals to establish peripheral percentiles with sufficient precision. This is feasible only through collaborative data sharing and the use of appropriate statistical methods. Broad application of this approach can be implemented through freely available Web-based software.},

Similar to a real person, a computer player can gradually increase its skill by learning from game-logs. Therefore, the game becomes more interesting. This paper proposes an extensible approach to mine experiential patterns from increasing game-logs. The computer player improves its strategies by utilizing these growing patterns, just as it acquires experience. To evaluate the effect and performance of the approach, we designed a sample board game as a test platform and elaborated an experiment consisting of a series of tests. Experimental results show that our approach is effective and efficient.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              – Business process has become the core assets of many organizations and it becomes increasing common for most medium to large organizations to have collections of hundreds or even thousands of business process models. The purpose of this paper is to explore an alternative dimension to process mining in which the objective is to extract process constraints (or business rules) as opposed to business process models. It also focusses on an alternative data set – process models as opposed to process instances (i.e. event logs).
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              – The authors present a new method of knowledge discovery to find business activity sequential patterns embedded in process model repositories. The extracted sequential patterns are considered as business rules.
            
            
              Findings
              – The authors find significant knowledge hidden in business processes model repositories. The hidden knowledge is considered as business rules. The business rules extracted from process models are significant and valid sequential correlations among business activities belonging to a particular organization. Such business rules represent business constraints that have been encoded in business process models. Experimental results have indicated the effectiveness and accuracy of the approach in extracting business rules from repositories of business process models.
            
            
              Social implications
              – This research will assist organizations to extract business rules from their existing business process models. The discovered business rules are very important for any organization, where rules can be used to help organizations better achieve goals, remove obstacles to market growth, reduce costly mistakes, improve communication, comply with legal requirements, and increase customer loyalty.
            
            
              Originality/value
              – There has very been little work in mining business process models as opposed to an increasing number of very large collections of business process models. This work has filled this gap with the focus on extracting business rules.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            International standards for well barrier integrity traditionally prescribe cement as annular sealing material. Despite a more than 100-year long history using cementing techniques, a high number of wells have poor annular integrity and are facing sustained casing pressure (SCP). A quality assessment of the cement seal is obtained by return volume and surface pressure trend calculations together with bond logs. All of these measurements are indirect and open for interpretation. Commonly, excess cement volumes are pumped to account for uncertainties but cement failure rate remains high.
            This paper describes an extensive testing and qualification program performed on a wireless downhole measurement system. Testing has been done on a component and system level basis on the permanently deployed equipment together with the hardware, software and telemetry on the equipment designed to retrieve the data. Focus has been given to robustness and simplicity to accurately capture the data of interest and ensure a fast and reliable download.
            A direct measurement of annular integrity is now available. A continuous pressure and temperature measurement, named the Well Data Monitor (WDM), can be mounted on the exterior of the casing or liner. The system is non-intrusive to the tubulars and communicates by acoustics through the pipe-wall. No control lines to surface are needed. Interrogation of the sensor pack will provide a full history of events from deployment to the time of download. Hence, historical pressure and temperature data are available from the time of deployment, through the process of establishment of annular barriers to the final verification test. The verification test will provide a direct and non-negotiable measurement of integrity.
            The development of the WDM was initiated following a need to provide verification for the Well Annular Barrier (WAB) to confirm to Norsok D-010 barrier requirements and to use the WAB as a barrier in open-hole.},

	abstract = {The Time Warp synchronization protocol for Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) is universally considered a viable solution to exploit the intrinsic simulation model parallelism and to provide model execution speedup. Yet it leads the PDES system to execute events in an order that may generate causal inconsistencies that need to be recovered via
              rollback
              , which requires restoration of a previous (consistent) simulation state whenever a causality violation is detected. The rollback operation is so critical for the performance of a Time Warp system that it has been extensively studied in the literature for decades to find approaches suitable to optimize it. The proposed solutions can be roughly classified as based on either
              checkpointing
              or
              reverse computing
              . In this article, we explore the practical design and implementation of a fully new approach based on the runtime generation of so-called
              undo code blocks
              , which are blocks of instructions implementing the reverse memory side effects generated by the forward execution of the events. However, this is not done by recomputing the original values to be restored, as instead it occurs in reverse computing schemes. Hence, the philosophy undo code blocks rely on is similar in spirit to that of undo-logs (as a form of checkpointing). Nevertheless, they are not data logs (as instead checkpoints are); rather, they are logs of instructions. Our proposal is fully transparent, thanks to the reliance on static software instrumentation (targeting the x86 architecture and Linux systems). Also, as we show, it can be combined with classical checkpointing to further improve the runtime behavior of the state recoverability support as a function of the workload. We also present experimental results related to our implementation, which is released as free software and fully integrated into the open source ROOT-Sim package. Experimental data support the viability and effectiveness of our proposal.},

The new implementation automatically logs all user actions, facilitates file management and disk cleaning, and allows convenient browsing of the history of a project. Moreover, new functionality to iteratively execute consecutive jobs allows on-the-fly image processing, which will lead to more efficient data acquisition by providing faster feedback on data quality. The possibility of exchanging data-processing procedures among users will contribute to the development of standardized image-processing procedures, and hence increase accessibility for new users in this rapidly expanding field.},

	abstract = {Dependent censoring often arises in biomedical studies when time to tumour progression (e.g., relapse of cancer) is censored by an informative terminal event (e.g., death). For meta-analysis combining existing studies, a joint survival model between tumour progression and death has been considered under semicompeting risks, which induces dependence through the study-specific frailty. Our paper here utilizes copulas to generalize the joint frailty model by introducing additional source of dependence arising from intra-subject association between tumour progression and death. The practical value of the new model is particularly evident for meta-analyses in which only a few covariates are consistently measured across studies and hence there exist residual dependence. The covariate effects are formulated through the Cox proportional hazards model, and the baseline hazards are nonparametrically modeled on a basis of splines. The estimator is then obtained by maximizing a penalized log-likelihood function. We also show that the present methodologies are easily modified for the competing risks or recurrent event data, and are generalized to accommodate left-truncation. Simulations are performed to examine the performance of the proposed estimator. The method is applied to a meta-analysis for assessing a recently suggested biomarker CXCL12 for survival in ovarian cancer patients. We implement our proposed methods in R joint.Cox package.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              Ireland’s physicians have a legal and an ethical duty to protect confidential patient information. Most healthcare records in Ireland remain paper based, so the purpose of this paper is to: assess the protection afforded to paper records; log highest risk records; note the variations that occurred during the working week; and observe the varying protection that occurred when staff, students and public members were present.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              A customised audit tool was created using Sphinx software. Data were collected for three months. All wards included in the study were visited once during four discrete time periods across the working week. The medical records trolley’s location was noted and total unattended medical records, total unattended nursing records, total unattended patient lists and when nursing personnel, medical students, public and a ward secretary were visibly present were recorded.
            
            
              Findings
              During 84 occasions when the authors visited wards, unattended medical records were identified on 33 per cent of occasions, 49 per cent were found during weekend visiting hours and just 4 per cent were found during morning rounds. The unattended medical records belonged to patients admitted to a medical specialty in 73 per cent of cases and a surgical specialty in 27 per cent. Medical records were found unattended in the nurses’ station with much greater frequency when the ward secretary was off duty. Unattended nursing records were identified on 67 per cent of occasions the authors visited the ward and were most commonly found unattended in groups of six or more.
            
            
              Practical implications
              This study is a timely reminder that confidential patient information is at risk from inappropriate disclosure in the hospital. There are few context-specific standards for data protection to guide healthcare professionals, particularly paper records. Nursing records are left unattended with twice the frequency of medical records and are found unattended in greater numbers than medical records. Protection is strongest when ward secretaries are on duty. Over-reliance on vigilant ward secretaries could represent a threat to confidential patient information.
            
            
              Originality/value
              While other studies identified data protection as an issue, this study assesses how data security varies inside and outside conventional working hours. It provides a rationale and an impetus for specific changes across the whole working week. By identifying the on-duty ward secretary’s favourable effect on medical record security, it highlights the need for alternative arrangements when the ward secretary is off duty. Data were collected prospectively in real time, giving a more accurate healthcare record security snapshot in each data collection point.},

	abstract = {Widgets have been deployed in rich internet applications for more than 10 years. However, many of the widgets currently available on the web do not implement current accessibility design solutions standardized in ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) specification, hence are not accessible to disabled users. This article sets out an approach for automatically identifying widgets on the basis of machine-learning algorithms and the classification of mutation records; it is an HTML5 technology that logs all changes that occur in the structure of a web application. Automatic widget identification is an essential component for the elaboration of automatic ARIA evaluation and adaptation strategies. Thus, the aim of this article is to take steps toward easing the software-engineering process of ARIA widgets. The proposed approach focuses on the identification of drop-down menu widgets. An experiment with real-world web applications was conducted and the results showed evidence that this approach is capable of identifying these widgets and can outperform previous state-of-the-art techniques based on an F-measure analysis conducted during the experiment.},

                :
              
              Ramp tests are continuously increasing exercise tests used for the determination of maximal oxygen uptake (), which is identifiable by a plateau in oxygen uptake despite increasing mechanical power output (LOAD). On wind-braked rowing ergometers (RowErg), it is hardly feasible to ensure a continuous increase in LOAD until test termination, as neither resistance nor stroke frequency is externally adjustable but depends on the rower. To enable ramp tests on RowErg, the authors produced visual stroke-by-stroke feedback showing target and actual LOAD to the rower. The software supports automatic test termination (TERM
              auto
              ) if LOAD ceases to increase. The authors aimed to evaluate linearity of the LOAD increment and calculate the difference between TERM
              auto
              and test duration at subjective exhaustion.
              
                Materials
                :
              
              Twenty-eight highly trained male rowers performed a ramp test until subjective exhaustion on RowErg, targeting an increment of 35 W·min
              −1
              . LOAD was measured as work per time via external force and position sensors and visualized on a computer screen. TERM
              auto
              was deactivated, but all data were logged. Test duration at subjective exhaustion was subsequently compared with virtual test duration at TERM
              auto
              calculated from the log files.
              
                Results
                :
              
              Regression between time and LOAD was
              y
               = 167 + 34.6 W (
              r
               = .99). Individual correlations ranged from .97 to 1.0. TERM
              auto
              caused 12- to 35-s-shorter test durations than subjective exhaustion in 4 rowers, leading to an underestimation in  not higher than 1.2\% or 3.7\%.
              
                Conclusion
                :
              
              This setup allows one to perform ramp tests on RowErg with continuously increasing LOAD until TERM

	abstract = {Abstract
            The Oil and Gas (O\&G) industry is embracing modern and intelligent digital technologies such as big data analytics, cloud services, machine learning etc. to increase productivity, enhance operations safety, reduce operation cost and mitigate adverse environmental impact. Challenges that come with such an oil field digital transformation include, but are certainly not limited to: information explosion; isolated and incompatible data repositories; logistics for data exchange and communication; obsoleted processes; cost of support; and the lack of data security. In this paper, we introduce an elastically scalable cloud-based platform to provide big data service for the upstream oil and gas industry, with high reliability and high performance on real-time or near real-time services based on industry standards. First, we review the nature of big data within O\&G, paying special attention to distributed fiber optic sensing technologies. We highlight the challenges and necessary system requirements to build effective and scalable downhole big data management and analytics. Secondly, we propose a cloud-based platform architecture for data management and analytics services. Finally, we will present multiple case studies and examples with our system as it is applied in the field. We demonstrate that a standardized data communication and security model enables high efficiency for data transmission, storage, management, sharing and processing in a highly secure environment. Using a standard big data framework and tools (e.g., Apache Hadoop, Spark and Kafka) together with machine learning techniques towards autonomous analysis of such data sources, we are able to process extremely large and complex datasets in an efficient way to provide real-time or near real-time data analytical service, including prescriptive and predictive analytics. The proposed integrated service comprises multiple main systems, such as a downhole data acquisition system; data exchange and management system; data processing and analytics system; as well as data visualization, event alerting and reporting system. With emerging fiber optic technologies, this system not only provides services using legacy O\&G data such as static reservoir information, fluid characteristics, well log, well completion information, downhole sensing and surface monitoring data, but also incorporates distributed sensing data (DxS) such as distributed temperature sensing (DTS), distributed strain sensing (DSS) and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) for continuous downhole measurements along the wellbore with very high spatial resolution. It is the addition of the fiber optic distributed sensing technology that has increased exponentially the volume of downhole data needed to be transmitted and securely managed.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The simulation and modelling paradigms have significantly shifted in recent years under the influence of the Industry 4.0 concept. There is a requirement for a much higher level of detail and a lower level of abstraction within the simulation of a modelled system that continuously develops. Consequently, higher demands are placed on the construction of automated process models. Such a possibility is provided by automated process discovery techniques. Thus, the paper aims to investigate the performance of automated process discovery techniques within the controlled environment. The presented paper aims to benchmark the automated discovery techniques regarding realistic simulation models within the controlled environment and, more specifically, the logistics process of a manufacturing company. The study is based on a hybrid simulation of logistics in a manufacturing company that implemented the AnyLogic framework. The hybrid simulation is modelled using the BPMN notation using BIMP, the business process modelling software, to acquire data in the form of event logs. Next, five chosen automated process discovery techniques are applied to the event logs, and the results are evaluated. Based on the evaluation of benchmark results received using the chosen discovery algorithms, it is evident that the discovery algorithms have a better overall performance using more extensive event logs both in terms of fitness and precision. Nevertheless, the discovery techniques perform better in the case of smaller data sets, with less complex process models. Typically, automated discovery techniques have to address scalability issues due to the high amount of data present in the logs. However, as demonstrated, the process discovery techniques can also encounter issues of opposite nature. While discovery techniques typically have to address scalability issues due to large datasets, in the case of companies with long delivery cycles, long processing times and parallel production, which is common for the industrial sector, they have to address issues with incompleteness and lack of information in datasets. The management of business companies is becoming essential for companies to stay competitive through efficiency. The issues encountered within the simulation model will be amplified through both vertical and horizontal integration of the supply chain within the Industry 4.0. The impact of vertical integration in the BPMN model and the chosen case identifier is demonstrated. Without the assumption of smart manufacturing, it would be impossible to use a single case identifier throughout the entire simulation. The entire process would have to be divided into several subprocesses.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE
              Many targeted therapies are currently available only via clinical trials. Therefore, routine precision oncology using biomarker-based assignment to drug depends on matching patients to clinical trials. A comprehensive and up-to-date trial database is necessary for optimal patient-trial matching.
            
            
              METHODS
              We describe processes for establishing and maintaining a clinical trial database, focusing on genomically informed trials. Furthermore, we present OCTANE (Oncology Clinical Trial Annotation Engine), an informatics framework supporting these processes in a scalable fashion. To illustrate how the framework can be applied at an institution, we describe how we implemented an instance of OCTANE at a large cancer center. OCTANE consists of three modules. The data aggregation module automates retrieval, aggregation, and update of trial information. The annotation module establishes the database schema, implements data integration necessary for automation, and provides an annotation interface. The update module monitors trial change logs, identifies critical change events, and alerts the annotators when manual intervention may be needed.
            
            
              RESULTS
              Using OCTANE, we annotated 5,439 oncology clinical trials (4,438 genomically informed trials) that collectively were associated with 1,453 drugs, 779 genes, and 252 cancer types. To date, we have used the database to screen 4,220 patients for trial eligibility. We compared the update module with expert review, and the module achieved 98.5\% accuracy, 0\% false-negative rate, and 2.3\% false-positive rate.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              OCTANE is a general informatics framework that can be helpful for establishing and maintaining a comprehensive database necessary for automating patient-trial matching, which facilitates the successful delivery of personalized cancer care on a routine basis. Several OCTANE components are publically available and may be useful to other precision oncology programs.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Cement behind casing, as the critical component of well integrity is a real challenge all over the world. Despite the efforts drilling operators and service providers dedicate to this phase of well construction in the South Pars gas field, final set cement quality does not establish zonal isolation in 9 5/8" casing and 12 1/4" openhole section.
            In order to study this issue, twenty-four wells have been analyzed based on theoretical analysis, close hands-on operations and track record of cementing in the field. Data were acquired from the daily drilling reports, data acquisition system of cement units, mud logging records, daily mud reports, cement slurry laboratory test sheets and wireline log records.
            The main effective factors on cement quality have been studied in four groups namely: well preparation, slurry design, mud removal and post-cementing practices. Good and poor quality cement in all wells have been compared with actual field parameters using a cementing displacement simulator software. Structural stress model has also performed for one of the wells whose cement was prone to be impacted by post cementing practices.
            Results have been obtained over one year of parallel laboratory testing, field experience, simulation and evaluation. The simulations results illustrate turbulent flow is not practical for cementing of this section and effective laminar flow technique shows an efficient alternative, however all criteria of this technique could not have been fully met due to some well restriction. The results reveal mud removal parameters in terms of casing centralization have significant effects on the final cement quality in this field. Cement quality devastation persisted even in cases where the cement slurry properties were modified and used in four wells in order to evaluate slurry design impact degree on final set cement quality. The stress model results illustrate that imposed stress on the well exceeds the compressive and tensile strength of the cement sheath. These results reinforce the idea that mud removal and post cementing practices govern the cement quality in the field.
            This paper is a comprehensive study of all effective parameters on cement quality in 9 5/8" casing cementing and highlight the main sources of cement quality devastation in the field and it can be used as a guideline for cementing similar cases around the world.},

              Background
              The emergence of Drug-Resistance Tuberculosis (DR-TB) is an increasing global public health problem. Lost to Follow-up (LTFU) from DR-TB treatment remains a major barrier to tuberculosis epidemic control and better treatment outcome. In Ethiopia, evidences on the incidence and predictors of LTFU are scarce. Thus, this study aimed to determine the incidence and identify the predictors of LTFU among DR-TB patients.
            
            
              Methods
              
                A retrospective follow-up study was conducted among a total of 332 DR-TB patients at the University of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital. Data were retrieved from patient records from September 2010 to December 2017 and entered in to Epi-data 4.2.0.0 and analysed using Stata14.1 software. The risk was estimated using the Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard curve. A log-rank test was used for survival comparisons between categories of independent variables. The Gompertz regression model was fitted, and hazard ratio with a 95\% confidence interval (CI) was used to measure the strength of associations. Variables with less than 0.05
                p
                -values in the multivariable model were considered as significantly associated with LTFU.
              
            
            
              Results
              Among a total of 332 patient records reviewed, 206 (62.05\%) were male. The median age was 30 years (Inter Quartile Range (IQR): 23–40). Forty-one (12.35\%) of the participants had no history of TB treatment, while a quarter of were TB-HIV co-infected. Closely all (92.17\%) of the patients had pulmonary tuberculosis. The median follow up time was 20.37 months (IQR: 11.02, 21.80). Thirty-six (10.84\%) patients were lost from follow-up with an incidence rate of 6.47 (95\% CI: 4.67, 8.97)/1000 Person Months (PM). Homelessness (Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR) =2.51, 95\%CI: 1.15, 5.45) and treatment enrolment year from 2013 to 2014 (AHR = 3.25, 95\% CI: 1.30, 8.13) were significant predictors of LTFU.
            
            
              Conclusion
              This study indicated that LTFU among DR-TB registered patients was high in the first six months compared to subsequent months. Homelessness and year of treatment enrolment were independent predictors of LTFU, requiring more economic support to patients in order to ensure treatment completion. This result can be generalized to patients who are using DR-TB treatment in similar settings.},

	abstract = {Summary
            Many biomedical studies focus on the association between a longitudinal measurement and a time-to-event outcome while quantifying this association by means of a longitudinal-survival joint model. In this article we propose using the \$LLR\$ test — a longitudinal extension of the log-rank test statistic given by Peto and Peto (1972) — to provide evidence of a plausible association between a time-to-event outcome (right- or interval-censored) and a time-dependent covariate. As joint model methods are complex and hard to interpret, it is wise to conduct a preliminary test such as \$LLR\$ for checking the association between both processes. The \$LLR\$ statistic can be expressed in the form of a weighted difference of hazards, yielding a broad class of weighted log-rank test statistics known as \$LWLR\$, which allow a specific emphasis along the time axis of the effects of the time-dependent covariate on the survival. The asymptotic distribution of \$LLR\$ is derived by means of a permutation approach under the assumption that the censoring mechanism is independent of the survival time and the longitudinal covariate. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the test statistics \$LLR\$ and \$LWLR\$, showing that the empirical size is close to the nominal significance level and that the power of the test depends on the association between the covariates and the survival time. A data set together with a toy example are used to illustrate the \$LLR\$ test. The data set explores the study Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (Sparling and others, 2006) which includes interval-censored data. A software implementation of our method is available on github (https://github.com/RamonOller/LWLRtest).},

	abstract = {Ocean acidification (OA) is the process whereby anthropogenic carbon dioxide is absorbed into seawater, resulting in altered carbonate chemistry and a decline in pH. OA will negatively impact numerous marine organisms, altering the structure and function of entire ecosystems. The progression
 of OA, while faster than has occurred in recent geological history, has been subtle and detection may be complicated by high variability in shallow-water environments. Nevertheless, comprehensive monitoring and characterization is important given the scale and severity of the problem. Presently,
 technologies used to measure OA in the field are costly and limited by their detection of only one carbonate chemistry parameter, such as pH. Discrete water samples, by contrast, offer a means of measuring multiple components of the carbonate system, including parameters of particular explanatory
 value (e.g., total alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon), for which field-based sensors do not presently exist. Here we describe the design, use, and performance of a low- cost ({\textless}\$220 USD) subsurface automated sampler (SAS), suitable for the collection of water for carbonate chemistry
 analysis. Each sampler is field-programmable using a remote control, performs in depths up to 55 m seawater, collects two separately preserved samples, and logs temperature at the time of collection. SAS are designed from the ground up to be open source with respect to physical design and
 sampling components, electronic hardware, and software. Build instructions, parts lists, and printable 3D files are provided along with code to ultimately lower the cost of OA monitoring, facilitate further research, and encourage application-specific customization.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The forward stratigraphic simulation approach is applied to predict porosity and permeability distribution. Synthetic well logs from the forward stratigraphic model served as secondary data to control porosity and permeability representation in the reservoir model. Building a reservoir model that fits data at different locations comes with high levels of uncertainty. Therefore, it is critical to generate an appropriate stratigraphic framework to guide lithofacies and associated porosity–permeability simulation. The workflow adopted for this task consists of three parts: first, there is simulation of 20 scenarios of sediment transportation and deposition using the geological process modelling (GPM™) software developed by Schlumberger. Secondly, there is an estimation of the extent and proportion of lithofacies units in the stratigraphic model using the property calculator tool in Petrel™. Finally, porosity and permeability values are assigned to corresponding lithofacies units in the forward stratigraphic model to produce a forward stratigraphic-based porosity and permeability model. Results show a forward stratigraphic-based lithofacies model, which depends on sediment diffusion rate, sea-level variation, sediment movement, wave processes, and tectonic events. This observation is consistent with the natural occurrence, where variations in sea level, sediment supply, and accommodation control stratigraphic sequences and therefore facies distribution in a geological basin. Validation wells VP1 and VP2 showed a notable match after a comparing the original and forward stratigraphic-based porosity models. However, a significant discrepancy is recorded in the permeability estimates. These results suggest that the forward stratigraphic modelling approach can be a practical addition to geostatistical-based workflows for realistic prediction of porosity and permeability.},

	abstract = {Distributed systems pose unique challenges for software developers. Understanding the system’s communication topology and reasoning about concurrent activities of system hosts can be difficult. The standard approach, analyzing system logs, can be a tedious and complex process that involves reconstructing a system log from multiple hosts’ logs, reconciling timestamps among hosts with non-synchronized clocks, and understanding what took place during the execution encoded by the log. This article presents a novel approach for tackling three tasks frequently performed during analysis of distributed system executions: (1) understanding the relative ordering of events, (2) searching for specific patterns of interaction between hosts, and (3) identifying structural similarities and differences between pairs of executions. Our approach consists of
              XVector
              , which instruments distributed systems to capture partial ordering information that encodes the happens-before relation between events, and
              ShiViz
              , which processes the resulting logs and presents distributed system executions as interactive time-space diagrams. Two user studies with a total of 109 students and a case study with 2 developers showed that our method was effective, helping participants answer statistically significantly more system-comprehension questions correctly, with a very large effect size.},

However, few studies have investigated the separate effects of different types of dairy on inflammation. Therefore, the current study aims to examine the separate prospective impacts of milk, yogurt and cheese on biomarkers of chronic inflammation in 1753 community-dwelling participants of the Framingham Offspring Study (FOS). Mean intakes of dairy foods were derived from two sets of three-day diet records. Six inflammatory biomarkers were assessed approximately seven years later at exam 7. Results showed that those who consumed yogurt (vs. those who did not) had statistically significantly lower levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) (mean log-transformed levels of 1.31 and 1.26 in consumers/non-consumers, respectively, p = 0.02) and fibrin (mean log-transformed levels of 5.91 and 5.89 in consumers/non-consumers, respectively, p = 0.03). The inverse association between IL-6 and yogurt consumption was similar in participants who were of normal weight and those who were overweight. For fibrin, the effects were stronger in overweight individuals. No statistically significant associations were observed between any of these inflammation biomarkers and milk or cheese intakes. Overall, our study compared the separate impacts of three types of dairy foods on chronic inflammation and found that only yogurt intake was linked with lower levels of chronic inflammation.},

	abstract = {Background: Length of stay is a significant indicator of care effectiveness and hospital performance. Owing to the limited number of healthcare centers and facilities, it is important to optimize length of stay and associated factors.Purpose: The present study aimed to investigate factors associated with neonatal length of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) using parametric and semiparametric models and compare model fitness according to Akaike information criterion (AIC) between 2016 and 2018.Methods: This retrospective cohort study reviewed 600 medical records of infants admitted to the NICU of Bandar Abbas Hospital. Samples were identified using census sampling. Factors associated with NICU length of stay were investigated based on semiparametric Cox model and 4 parametric models including Weibull, exponential, log-logistic, and log-normal to determine the best fitted model. The data analysis was conducted using R software. The significance level was set at 0.05.Results: The study findings suggest that breastfeeding, phototherapy, acute renal failure, presence of mechanical ventilation, and availability of central venous catheter were commonly identified as factors associated with NICU length of stay in all 5 models (\textit{P}{\textless}0.05). Parametric models showed better fitness than the Cox model in this study.Conclusion: Breastfeeding and availability of central venous catheter had protective effects against length of stay, whereas phototherapy, acute renal failure, and mechanical ventilation increased length of stay in NICU. Therefore, the identification of factors associated with NICU length of stay can help establish effective interventions aimed at decreasing the length of stay among infants.},

	abstract = {Collaborative work in Building Information Modeling (BIM) projects is frequently understood as the interaction of modelers in an asynchronous way through modification requests or via e-mail/telephone. However, alternative work methodologies based on creating a common and synchronous environment allow solving issues instantaneously during the design process. This study aimed to analyze the behavior and performance of BIM users with different specialties who were subjected to an experimental exercise in a collaborative environment. For this purpose, a process was devised to collect, sort, and select the data from the log files generated by the BIM software. A timeline of the experiment was populated with data on the intensity and types of commands used by each specialist, which allowed determining behavioral patterns, preferred commands, indicators of their experience, further training needs, and possible strategies for improving the team’s performance. In the experiment, the mechanical designer’s performance was 49\% and the rest approximately 64\%, with respect to that of the architect. An average rate of 1.66 necessary or auxiliary commands for each contributory command was detected. The average performance was 200–400 commands per hour, which intensified by the end of the experiment. Further training needs were detected for the plumbing designer to reduce the use of backwards commands. Conversely, the electrical designer showed a positive evolution regarding this aspect during the experiment. The analysis methods here described become useful for the aforementioned purposes. Nevertheless, combinations with methods from existing research might improve the outcomes and therefore the specificity of recommendations.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Sonic imaging is a technique to obtain a high-resolution acoustic image of the earth formation structures several meters away from the well by utilizing the azimuthal sonic waveforms recorded for extended listening times downhole. The method has been used since the early 1990's to identify subseismic scale features (boundaries, faults, fractures, etc.) by migrating the sonic waveforms into a high- resolution 2D image.
            Over the past two decades, the sonic imaging in the oil industry has been looked at as a ‘niche’ service. Limitations in acquisition telemetry to handle large datasets downhole and surface software processing capabilities as well as long job turnaround times have meant that sonic imaging service was primarily done on very few wells. Recently, sonic imaging has regained the interest of the community for input to structural modeling along with advancements of higher downhole data transmission capabilities and more powerful processing capabilities. The processing workflow itself, however, has mainly largely remained the same and has consisted of first filtering the sonic waveforms to reduce the interference of the borehole modes and then migrating the filtered waveforms to obtain a 2D image of a well section. Although the 2D image obtained from sonic data is of much higher resolution as compared to other available images such as surface seismic data and vertical seismic profiling (VSP), it does not provide quantitative information on the true dip and azimuth of the acoustic reflectors. With the advancements in the use of borehole resistivity images for geomodeling, the true dip and azimuth information is now essential for fracture characterization and structural geomodeling.
            We introduce a new technique to obtain reflector location and associated attributes such as true dip and azimuth from fractures, faults, and layering from azimuthal sonic waveform measurements. The technique consists of two main steps. In the first step, an automated time pick and event localization procedures collect possible reflections from filtered waveforms; in the second step, an automatic ray tracing and 3D slowness time coherence (STC) procedure determines the ray path type and a 3D structural map of the reflector, as well as its true dip and azimuth. This technique also provides appropriate parameters for the orientation of the optimum 2D plane to migrate for the traditional image. The new technique enables determining the key parameters of true dip, azimuth, and reflector locations from higher-resolution sonic data required for reservoir evaluation and geomodeling. Direct integration with borehole resistivity images provides an opportunity to build a more accurate single-well structural model for identifying formation dip as well as a near-wellbore connectivity to far-field fractures.
            This technique has been demonstrated using a case study, where sonic data were recorded in a horizontal well placed in unconventional Wolfcamp formation of North America. Characterization of natural fractures was critical for well completion and hydraulic fracturing. The 3D slowness time coherence (STC) results derived from multi-spaced and multi-azimuthal sonic data provided dip and azimuth of the fractures, which showed good agreement with image log interpretation. Image log results, which provides near-field information, were complimented with far-field 3D STC results.},

              Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) have been recommended to prevent of heterotopic ossification (HO) after total hip arthroplasty (THA), but debates are still ongoing. The present Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) compared all available pathways of NSAID treatment as prophylaxis for HO after THA. The present Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted according to The PRISMA Extension Statement for Reporting of Systematic Reviews Incorporating Network Meta-analyses of Health Care Interventions guidelines. All randomized clinical trials comparing two or more interventions to prevent HO after THA were considered for analysis. HO was classified according to Brooker. The quality of the methodological assessment was performed through the risk of bias summary tool of the Review Manager Software 5.3 (The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen). The network meta-analysis was performed through a STATA routine for Bayesian hierarchical random-effects model analysis, with log odd ratio (LOR) effect measure. Data from 26 studies (6396 THAs; 58\% females) were collected. The mean follow-up was 10.50 ± 5.7 months. ANOVA showed good comparability among mean age and gender (
              P
               {\textgreater} 0.5). Celecoxib demonstrated the highest rate of Brooker class 0 (LOR 6.96), followed by diclofenac (LOR 6.94). Naproxen demonstrated the lowest rate of Brooker I HO (LOR 2.82), followed by celecoxib (LOR 3.52). Celecoxib demonstrated lowest rate of Brooker class II HO (LOR 1.66), class III (LOR), and class IV (LOR 0.25). The equation for global linearity detected no statistically significant inconsistency (
              P
               {\textgreater} 0.5) in all the comparisons. The present Bayesian network meta-analysis encourages the use of celecoxib as a prophylaxis for HO. These conclusions must be interpreted in light of the limitations of the present study. Future investigations are required to establish more definitely the role of celecoxib.

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to answer the questions: What challenges do students face in an information commons and how does roving reference help?.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The author recounts her work roving in her community college information commons and supplements this with an analysis of 1,500 records from her detailed reference log that compares roving reference results with conventional references and with reference questions as a whole.
            
            
              Findings
              Her autoethnography and data reveal that roving substantially increases the number of reference encounters. In addition, her data sheds light on students’ struggles with common, productivity software, academic packages and malfunctioning hardware. More importantly, these findings show that roving reference data identify problems that librarians, as stakeholders, can solve.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              Roving reference in a community college information commons brings students in one library into sharper focus. Roving reference increases the number of reference encounters and the reach of reference service. It also exposes a use-based digital divide that calls for collaboration in the long run and increased point-of-need service immediately.
            
            
              Practical implications
              Even data that points to digital divides, hardware issues or other shortcomings and offers empirical evidence of problems for which library staff, unlike student workers, can find long-term solutions. This study shows that it is possible to gather rich and extensive data with minimal personnel and off-the-shelf software.
            
            
              Social implications
              A college degree is vital to social mobility and easing inequality. Fluency with academic technology and information is necessary for completing college. Roving reference means more opportunities to teach information and computer fluency at point of need and more opportunities for librarian stakeholders to find and remove obstacles to student learning.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This is one of the few, recent studies, autoethnographic or otherwise, on roving reference in a community college library’s information commons.},

	abstract = {Aims
              Our aim was to explore sex differences and inequalities in terms of medical management and cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes in a low/middle-income country (LMIC), where reports are scarce.
            
            
              Methods
              We examined sex differences in presentation, management and clinical outcomes in 21 374 patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in Kerala, India enrolled in the Acute Coronary Syndrome Quality Improvement in Kerala trial. The main outcomes were the rates of in-hospital and 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) defined as composite of death, reinfarction, stroke and major bleeding. We fitted log Poisson multivariate random effects models to obtain the relative risks comparing women with men, and adjusted for clustering by centre and for age, CVD risk factors and cardiac presentation.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 5191 (24.3\%) patients were women. Compared with men, women presenting with ACS were older (65±12 vs 58±12 years; p{\textless}0.001), more likely to have hypertension and diabetes. They also had longer symptom onset to hospital presentation time (median, 300 vs 238 min; p{\textless}0.001) and were less likely to receive primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (45.9\% vs 49.8\% of men, p{\textless}0.001). After adjustment, women were more likely to experience in-hospital (adjusted relative risk (RR)=1.53; 95\% CI 1.32 to 1.77; p{\textless}0.001) and 30-day MACE (adjusted RR=1.39; 95\% CI 1.23 to 1.57, p{\textless}0.001).
            
            
              Conclusion
              Women presenting with ACS in Kerala, India had greater burden of CVD risk factors, including hypertension and diabetes mellitus, longer delays in presentation, and were less likely to receive guideline-directed management. Women also had worse in-hospital and 30-day outcomes. Further efforts are needed to understand and reduce cardiovascular care disparities between men and women in LMICs.},

	abstract = {Emergency management controllers throughout the developed world use various information technologies to help them manage emergencies. These emergencies can evolve rapidly, meaning that efficient information management is needed to minimize a range of uncertainties. Interviews with 12 emergency operation center controllers, from diverse areas of New Zealand, were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Results of this analysis suggested that each center uses one or more software options to manage response-related information, such as: hazard assessments, task and event logs, and intelligence received in a range of formats. Their use of different software and non-electronic options appears to vary according to the experience of each emergency management controller. The current research has highlighted a range of considerations that need to be considered when developing information technologies for emergency management. As a whole, the current paper provides a rare and tangible look at how information technology is being used by important decision makers facing hard-to-predict emergency conditions in a developed country context.},

              Background
              Gonorrhea diagnosis rates in the United States increased by 75\% during 2009–2017, predominantly in men. It is unclear whether the increase among men is being driven by more screening, an increase in the prevalence of disease, or both. We sought to evaluate changes in gonorrhea testing patterns and positivity among men in Massachusetts.
            
            
              Methods
              The analysis included men (aged ≥15 years) who received care during 2010–2017 in 3 clinical practice groups. We calculated annual percentages of men with ≥1 gonorrhea test and men with ≥1 positive result, among men tested. Log-binomial regression models were used to examine trends in these outcomes. We adjusted for clinical and demographic characteristics that may influence the predilection to test and probability of gonorrhea disease.
            
            
              Results
              On average, 306 348 men had clinical encounters each year. There was a significant increase in men with ≥1 gonorrhea test from 2010 (3.1\%) to 2017 (6.4\%; adjusted annual risk ratio, 1.12; 95\% confidence interval, 1.12–1.13). There was a significant, albeit lesser, increase in the percentage of tested men with ≥1 positive result (1.0\% in 2010 to 1.5\% in 2017; adjusted annual risk ratio, 1.07; 95\% confidence interval, 1.04–1.09).
            
            
              Conclusions
              We estimated significant increases in the annual percentages of men with ≥1 gonorrhea test and men with ≥1 positive gonorrhea test result between 2010 and 2017. These results suggest that observed increases in gonorrhea rates could be explained by both increases in screening and the prevalence of gonorrhea.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Virtual patient software allows health professionals to practise their skills by interacting with tools simulating clinical scenarios. A natural language dialogue system can provide natural interaction for medical history-taking. However, the large number of concepts and terms in the medical domain makes the creation of such a system a demanding task. We designed a dialogue system that stands out from current research by its ability to handle a wide variety of medical specialties and clinical cases. To address the task, we designed a patient record model, a knowledge model for the task and a termino-ontological model that hosts structured thesauri with linguistic, terminological and ontological knowledge. We used a frame- and rule-based approach and terminology-rich resources to handle the medical dialogue. This work focuses on the termino-ontological model, the challenges involved and how the system manages resources for the French language. We adopted a comprehensive approach to collect terms and ontological knowledge, and dictionaries of affixes, synonyms and derivational variants. Resources include domain lists containing over 161,000 terms, and dictionaries with over 959,000 word/concept entries. We assessed our approach by having 71 participants (39 medical doctors and 32 non-medical evaluators) interact with the system and use 35 cases from 18 specialities. We conducted a quantitative evaluation of all components by analysing interaction logs (11,834 turns). Natural language understanding achieved an F-measure of 95.8\%. Dialogue management provided on average 74.3 (±9.5)\% of correct answers. We performed a qualitative evaluation by collecting 171 five-point Likert scale questionnaires. All evaluated aspects obtained mean scores above the Likert mid-scale point. We analysed the vocabulary coverage with regard to unseen cases: the system covered 97.8\% of their terms. Evaluations showed that the system achieved high vocabulary coverage on unseen cases and was assessed as relevant for the task.},

              Closed-loop brain stimulation is increasingly used in level 4 epilepsy centers without an understanding of how the device behaves on a daily basis. This lack of insight is a barrier to improving closed-loop therapy and ultimately understanding why some patients never achieve seizure reduction. We aimed to quantify the accuracy of closed-loop seizure detection and stimulation on the RNS device through extrapolating information derived from manually reviewed ECoG recordings and comprehensive device logging information. RNS System event logging data were obtained, reviewed, and analyzed using a custom-built software package. A weighted-means methodology was developed to adjust for bias and incompleteness in event logs and evaluated using Bland–Altman plots and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare adjusted and non-weighted (standard method) results. Twelve patients implanted for a mean of 21.5 (interquartile range 13.5–31) months were reviewed. The mean seizure frequency reduction post-RNS implantation was 40.1\% (interquartile range 0–96.2\%). Three primary levels of event logging granularity were identified (ECoG recordings: 3.0\% complete (interquartile range 0.3–1.8\%); Event Lists: 72.9\% complete (interquartile range 44.7–99.8\%); Activity Logs: 100\% complete; completeness measured with respect to Activity Logs). Bland–Altman interpretation confirmed non-equivalence with unpredictable differences in both magnitude and direction. Wilcoxon signed rank tests demonstrated significant (

              ) differences in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity at {\textgreater}5\% absolute mean difference for extrapolated versus standard results. Device behavior logged by the RNS System should be used in conjunction with careful review of stored ECoG data to extrapolate metrics for detector performance and stimulation.},

	abstract = {Process mining is a research discipline that applies data analysis and computational intelligence techniques to extract knowledge from event logs of information systems. It aims to provide new means to discover, monitor, and improve processes. Process mining has gained particular attention over recent years and new process mining software tools, both academic and commercial, have been developed. This paper provides a survey of process mining software tools. It identifies and describes criteria that can be useful for comparing the tools. Furthermore, it introduces a multi-criteria methodology that can be used for the comparative analysis of process mining software tools. The methodology is based on three methods, namely ontology, decision tree, and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), that can be used to help users decide which software tool best suits their needs.},

	abstract = {Sawmilling operations are typically one of the most important cells of the wood supply chain as they take the log assortments as inputs to which they add value by processing lumber and other semi-finite products. For this kind of operations, and especially for those developed at a small scale, long-term monitoring data is a prerequisite to make decisions, to increase the operational efficiency and to enable the precision of operations. In many cases, however, collection and handling of such data is limited to a set of options which may come at high costs. In this study, a low-cost solution integrating offline object tracking, signal processing and artificial intelligence was tested to evaluate its capability to correctly classify in the time domain the events specific to the monitoring of wood sawmilling operations. Discrete scalar signals produced from media files by tracking functionalities of the Kinovea® software (13,000 frames) were used to derive a differential signal, then a filtering-to-the-root procedure was applied to them. Both, the raw and filtered signals were used as inputs in the training of an artificial neural network at two levels of operational detail: fully and essentially documented data. While the addition of the derived signal made sense because it improved the outcomes of classification (recall of 92–97\%) filtered signals were found to add less contribution to the classification accuracy. The use of essentially documented data has improved substantially the classification outcomes and it could be an excellent solution in monitoring applications requiring a basic level of detail. The tested system could represent a good and cheap solution to monitor sawmilling facilities aiming to develop our understanding on their technical efficiency.},

	abstract = {Hintergrund: Die Anwendung von problembasierter und fallbasierter Lehre ist in der medizinischen sowie tiermedizinischen Ausbildung in den letzten Jahren angestiegen. An einigen tiermedizinischen Einrichtungen zeigt sich diese Entwicklung vornehmlich im klinischen Teil der veterinärmedizinischen Ausbildung. Daher hat eine Arbeitsgruppe, bestehend aus Dozierenden der Biochemie und Physiologie zusammen mit technischen und didaktischen Experten das EU-finanzierte Projekt „vetVIP“ ins Leben gerufen, um tiermedizinische virtuelle Patienten und Probleme für die Lehre der Grundlagenfächer zu erstellen und zu implementieren. In dieser Projektstudie wurden sowohl die Implementierung, als auch die Nutzung und Anwendung von virtuellen Patienten an den tierärztlichen Fakultäten in Budapest, Hannover und Lublin untersucht.
  
  Material und Methoden: Dieser Artikel beschreibt Untersuchungen zur Nutzung und Akzeptanz eines optionalen Zusatzangebotes in Form von online Lernmaterialen an Studierenden im tiermedizinischen Grundlagenstudium, welches begleitend zu den regulären Lehrveranstaltungen in den Fächern der Biochemie und Physiologie angeboten wurde.
  
  Die Reaktion der Studierenden auf dieses Angebot von klinisch fallbasierter Lehre in den Grundlagenwissenschaften wurde anhand quantitativer und qualitativer Daten analysiert. Zum einen wurden quantitative Daten innerhalb des gewählten Software-Systems CASUS als Nutzer-Logbuch-Dateien automatisch gesammelt. Zum anderen wurden Rückmeldungen in Bezug auf die Qualität der virtuellen Patienten mit Hilfe eines Online-Fragebogens erhoben. Darüber hinaus wurde die subjektive Bewertung durch die Fallautoren anhand einer Fokusgruppendiskussion sowie anschließenden Online-Befragung durchgeführt.
  
  Ergebnisse: Sowohl die Implementierung, als auch die Nutzung und Akzeptanz variierte an den beteiligten drei Standorten. Eine hohe Zustimmung wurde in Hannover und Lublin anhand der hohen freiwilligen Beteiligung von Studierenden (\&gt;70\%), welche die optionalen virtuellen Patienten genutzt haben, dokumentiert. Wohingegen die Beteiligung in Budapest unter 1\% lag. Aufgrund der Nutzungsdaten lässt sich ableiten, dass die Studierenden virtuelle Patienten und Probleme bevorzugen, die in ihrer Muttersprache geschrieben und an ihrer eigenen Universität entwickelt wurden. Zusätzlich wurde der „Assessment Drives Learning“-Effekt durch die Beobachtung gestützt, dass die Spitzenauslastung der Fallbearbeitungen kurz vor den Abschlussprüfungen im Fach Biochemie lag.
  
  Schlussfolgerung: Veterinärmedizinische virtuelle Patienten können bereits in den Grundlagenwissenschaften eingeführt und für die Darstellung integrativer klinischer Fallszenarien verwendet werden. Anmerkungen der Studierenden nach dem Kurs unterstützen die These, dass der Einsatz von virtuellen Fallbeispielen insgesamt die Motivation für das Lernen der veterinärmedizinischen Grundlagenwissenschaften steigert.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            The selection and weighting of ground-motion models (GMMs) introduces a significant source of uncertainty in U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Seismic Hazard Modeling Project (NSHMP) forecasts. In this study, we evaluate 18 candidate GMMs using instrumental ground-motion observations of horizontal peak ground acceleration (PGA) and 5\%-damped pseudospectral acceleration (0.02–10 s) for tectonic earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, to inform logic-tree weights for the update of the USGS seismic hazard model for Hawaii. GMMs are evaluated using two methods. The first is a total residual visualization approach that compares the probability density function (PDF), mean and standard deviations σ, of the observed and predicted ground motion. The second GMM evaluation method we use is the common total residual probabilistic scoring method (log likelihood [LLH]). The LLH method provides a single score that can be used to weight GMMs in the Hawaii seismic hazard model logic trees. The total residual PDF approach provides additional information by preserving GMM over- and underprediction across a broad spectrum of periods that is not available from a single value LLH score. We apply these GMM evaluation methods to two different data sets: (1) a database of instrumental ground motions from historic earthquakes in Hawaii from 1973 to 2007 (Mw 4–7.3) and (2) available ground motions from recent earthquakes (Mw 4–6.9) associated with 2018 Kilauea eruptions. The 2018 Kilauea sequence contains both volcanic eruptions and tectonic earthquakes allowing for statistically significant GMM comparisons of the two event classes. The Kilauea ground observations provide an independent data set allowing us to evaluate the predictive power of GMMs implemented in the new USGS nshmp-haz software system. We evaluate GMM performance as a function of earthquake depth and we demonstrate that short-period volcanic eruption ground motions are not well predicted by any candidate GMMs. Nine of the initial 18 candidate GMMs fit the observed ground motions and meet established criteria for inclusion in the update of the Hawaii seismic hazard model. A weighted mean of four top performing GMMs in this study (NGAsubslab, NGAsubinter, ASK14, A10) is 50\% lower for PGA than for GMMS used in the previous USGS seismic hazard model for Hawaii.},

              Summary
              Skyline is a Windows application for targeted mass spectrometry method creation and quantitative data analysis. Like most graphical user interface (GUI) tools, it has a complex user interface with many ways for users to edit their files which makes the task of logging user actions challenging and is the reason why audit logging of every change is not common in GUI tools. We present an object comparison-based approach to audit logging for Skyline that is extensible to other GUI tools. The new audit logging system keeps track of all document modifications made through the GUI or the command line and displays them in an interactive grid. The audit log can also be uploaded and viewed in Panorama, a web repository for Skyline documents that can be configured to only accept documents with a valid audit log, based on embedded hashes to protect log integrity. This makes workflows involving Skyline and Panorama more reproducible.

              Background
              
                Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are typically visualized using a two-dimensional Manhattan plot, displaying chromosomal location of SNPs along the x-axis and the negative log-10 of their
                p
                -value on the y-axis. This traditional plot provides a broad overview of the results, but offers little opportunity for interaction or expansion of specific regions, and is unable to show additional dimensions of the dataset.
              
            
            
              Results
              We created BigTop, a visualization framework in virtual reality (VR), designed to render a Manhattan plot in three dimensions, wrapping the graph around the user in a simulated cylindrical room. BigTop uses the z-axis to display minor allele frequency of each SNP, allowing for the identification of allelic variants of genes. BigTop also offers additional interactivity, allowing users to select any individual SNP and receive expanded information, including SNP name, exact values, and gene location, if applicable. BigTop is built in JavaScript using the React and A-Frame frameworks, and can be rendered using commercially available VR headsets or in a two-dimensional web browser such as Google Chrome. Data is read into BigTop in JSON format, and can be provided as either JSON or a tab-separated text file.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Using additional dimensions and interactivity options offered through VR, we provide a new, interactive, three-dimensional representation of the traditional Manhattan plot for displaying and exploring GWAS data.},

	abstract = {Background
              The American Joint Committee on Cancer-Tumor (AJCC-T) staging system for esophageal carcinoma patients, which is based on the depth of tumor invasion, is not applicable in some cases. This study aims to assess the prognostic value of CT imaging-based tumor volume and its usefulness for T staging in patients with non-surgical esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
            
            
              Methods
              
                We retrospectively reviewed the records of 158 ESCC patients undergoing definitive (chemo) radiotherapy from two hospitals. Tumor volume based on the CT imaging was calculated using the formula: V = π
                abc
                / 6. Three cutoff points for tumor volume were obtained with the X-tile software. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method. The -2 log-likelihood ratio and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value were evaluated to compare the AJCC-T staging system with the proposed T staging method.
              
            
            
              Results
              The median tumor volume was 19.8 cm³ (range from 1.0 to 319.5 cm³). The three optimal cutoff points of tumor volume were 12.7, 22.8, and 51.9 cm³, and the patients were divided into four groups named as proposed T1–T4 stages. The 3-year OS rates in patients with proposed T1 to T4 stages were 67.9\%, 30.6\%, 21.3\%, and 5.3\%, respectively. The −2 log-likelihood ratios of the AJCC-T stage and proposed T stage were 1,068.060 and 1,047.418, respectively. The difference in the AIC value between the two T staging systems was 18.642.
            
            
              Conclusion
              CT imaging-based tumor volume was superior to the depth of tumor invasion for T staging in predicting the prognosis of non-surgical ESCC patient.},

	abstract = {Research on single event effects (SEEs) is significant to the design and manufacture of modern electronic devices. By applying two photon absorption (TPA) ultra-fast pulsed lasers, extra electron-hole pairs (EHPs) are generated in a desired location on a chip, simulating the process that could occur in the circuit by energetic particles. In this study, a SEE sensitivity mapping system is described which uses this method to generate real-time sensitivity maps for various electronic devices. The system hardware includes an attenuator to control the energy, a Pockels cell as a fast-optical switcher and a mirror–mirror module to project the laser beam into a certain location. The system software developed for this application controls the laser system, automatically generates sensitivity maps, communicates with the testing devices and logs the SEE results. The two main features of this laser mapping system are: high scanning velocity for large area scanning (about 1 × 1 mm) and high spatial resolution for small area scanning (about 1 × 1 μm). To verify this mapping system, sensitivity maps were generated for static random access memory (SRAM) built with 65 nm technology and for commercial operational amplifiers (op-amps). The achieved sensitivity maps were compared with circuitry analysis and laser testing results, confirming this mapping system to be effective.},

The   system is supposed to be used in practical forestry to replace manual   measurement of length of deep ruts and to provide spatially explicated information on soil bearing   capacity, which can be used in planning of forest operations.  A set of 4 pairs of ultra  sonic sensors were installed on front and rear bunks to measure distance   to the ground at 90  o  angle (in front and behind the wheels in each side of forwarder) and at certain   angle to measure distance to the ground outside strip  -  road. Measurement data are s  ent to the   logger, where they are stored in .csv files. Wired connection between the sensors and the logger   was used in earlier version, but later replaced with wireless connection. Depth of rut is calculated   using formula for calculation of length of cath  etus of a right  -  angled triangle. Data processing in   spreadsheet includes initial identification of error values and calculation of depth of ruts. Further   spatial data analysis is done in GIS software.  According to the study results ultrasonic sensors provi  des sufficient accuracy to characterize   depth of ruts in 1...5  m long segments of strip  -  roads, including dynamic data on depth and length   of ruts after each pass. However, the accuracy is insufficient to compare measurements from   sensors mounted on front a  nd rear bunks, as well as on left and right side of machine, therefore it   is enough to have 2 pairs on sensors on rear bunks.},

	abstract = {The amount of research conducted on geothermal energy as a source for heating and cooling demands of buildings, as well as for electrical energy production, has increased substantially in the past decades. The simulation of freezing and thawing is important for geothermal applications involving ground coupled heat pumps. One area of research is the development of grout cements for borehole heat exchangers (BHE). In many cases, BHEs are operated at temperatures below 0° C due to manifold reasons. Hence, the simulation of freezing and thawing cycles (FTC) is important for such geothermal applications, especially in cold regions. Recently, a testing device for measuring and quantifying the influence of FTC stresses on the mechanical integrity and hydraulic properties of BHE grouts was developed (Anbergen, published in 2014). The testing procedure simulates the downhole in situ conditions as confining radial earth pressure, freezing, and thawing directions from the inside to the outside and under saturated conditions. The hydraulic conductivity can be measured in axial flow direction. Thus, statements regarding the susceptibility of grouts against cyclic freezing and thawing stresses can be made. These results differ substantially from earlier findings, as in situ boundary conditions were not simulated sufficiently. For the verification of the procedure’s thermal process, temperature logs were recorded using thermocouples and thermography imaging. The thermal process was simulated using the finite element method (FEM) groundwater, heat, and mass modeling software FEFLOW. FEFLOW is a common software solution for thermohydraulic coupled groundwater applications with mass transport, as well as geothermal applications. However, up until now, the program could not yet simulate phase changes between solid and liquid phases. To enable the program for such simulations, a plug-in was developed. To do this, a C++ code was written and coupled to the simulation routine of the FEM software. The code is based on a modification of the material parameters of fluid and the incorporation of the latent heat effects in the fluid heat capacity. A linear and an exponential approach for the latent heat release were implemented and benchmarked. The code was verified using different analytical solutions and other FEM codes. Finally, the experimental results of the test procedure could be successfully computed using the new plug-in. Thus, it is now possible to compute phase changes with FEFLOW for geothermal applications as well as other applications like permafrost research.},

	abstract = {Background
              An increasing number of software companies work according to the agile software development method, which is difficult to integrate with user-centered design (UCD) practices. Log file analysis may provide opportunities for integrating UCD practices in the agile process. However, research within health care information technology mostly has a theoretical approach and is often focused on the researcher’s interpretation of log file analyses.
            
            
              Objective
              We aimed to propose a systematic approach to log file analysis in this study and present this to developers to explore how they react and interpret this approach in the context of a real-world health care information system, in an attempt to answer the following question: How may log file analyses contribute to increasing the match between the health care system and its users, within the agile development method, according to agile team members?
            
            
              Methods
              This study comprised 2 phases to answer the research question. In the first phase, log files were collected from a health care information system and subsequently analyzed (summarizing sequential patterns, heat mapping, and clustering). In the second phase, the results of these analyses are presented to agile professionals during a focus group interview. The interpretations of the agile professionals are analyzed by open axial coding.
            
            
              Results
              Log file data of 17,924 user sessions and, in total, 176,678 activities were collected. We found that the Patient Timeline is mainly visited, with 23,707 (23,707/176,678; 13.42\%) visits in total. The main unique user session occurred in 5.99\% (1074/17,924) of all user sessions, and this comprised Insert Measurement Values for Patient and Patient Timeline, followed by the page Patient Settings and, finally, Patient Treatment Plan. In the heat map, we found that users often navigated to the pages Insert Measurement Values and Load Messages Collaborate. Finally, in the cluster analysis, we found 5 clusters, namely, the Information-seeking cluster, the Collaborative cluster, the Mixed cluster, the Administrative cluster, and the Patient-oriented cluster. We found that the interpretations of these results by agile professionals are related to stating hypotheses (n=34), comparing paths (n=31), benchmarking (n=22), and prioritizing (n=17).
            
            
              Conclusions
              We found that analyzing log files provides agile professionals valuable insights into users’ behavior. Therefore, we argue that log file analyses should be used within agile development to inform professionals about users’ behavior. In this way, further UCD research can be informed by these results, making the methods less labor intensive. Moreover, we argue that these translations to an approach for further UCD research will be carried out by UCD specialists, as they are able to infer which goals the user had when going through these paths when looking at the log data.},

One such software is MobilePatrol: Public Safety App, a free to use mobile phone application marketed by data and analytics company Appriss Safety. It compiles information including mug shot photos, sex offender lists, and most wanted profiles for public access. To capture carceral visuality on the application, I conduct an ethnographic content analysis of police use in upstate New York. I penned a daily user log, took in-app “screenshots”, and analyzed user product reviews. I find that MobilePatrol reinforces an emerging new carceral visibility where an assemblage of police records are rapidly disseminated for widespread consumption, further driving data-led state entrenchment into the public sphere.},

	abstract = {Introduction:
              This study was undertaken to review a single-institution cohort of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer undergoing lung resection after a multidisciplinary evaluation and to investigate the main prognostic factors for survival.
            
            
              Methods:
              Medical records of 129 patients undergoing lung metastasectomy for colorectal cancer with curative intent from 2001 to 2017 were reviewed. Tissue samples from the primary tumor were analyzed with a multiplex genotyping system for the detection of mutations in RAS and BRAF genes. Survival analyses were carried out by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed using the log-rank test and the Cox regression model.
            
            
              Results:
              Postoperative morbidity and mortality were 13.2\% and 0\%, respectively. At a median follow-up time of 62.5 months, median overall survival was 90.5 months and median relapse-free survival was 42.8 months. Multivariable analysis for overall survival identified synchronous versus metachronous metastatic presentation as the only prognostic factor, whereas relapse-free survival was independently associated with synchronous versus metachronous metastatic presentation, number of metastases, and postoperative chemotherapy.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              This study shows particularly favorable survival outcomes for patients undergoing lung metastasectomy. The validity of some of the main prognostic factors was confirmed and a positive effect of postoperative chemotherapy on relapse-free survival was shown. Contrary to other reports, the presence of KRAS mutations was not associated with significant survival differences. Further studies are needed in order to clarify the interactions between molecular, clinical, and pathologic characteristics and treatment-related factors.},

	abstract = {The main purpose of an application performance monitoring/management (APM) software is to ensure the highest availability, efficiency and security of applications. An APM software accomplishes the main goals through automation, measurements, analysis and diagnostics. Gartner specifies the three crucial capabilities of APM softwares. The first is an end-user experience monitoring for revealing the interactions of users with application and infrastructure components. The second is application discovery, diagnostics and tracing. The third key component is machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) powered data analytics for predictions, anomaly detection, event correlations and root cause analysis. Time series metrics, logs and traces are the three pillars of observability and the valuable source of information for IT operations. Accurate, scalable and robust time series forecasting and anomaly detection are the requested capabilities of the analytics. Approaches based on neural networks (NN) and deep learning gain an increasing popularity due to their flexibility and ability to tackle complex nonlinear problems. However, some of the disadvantages of NN-based models for distributed cloud applications mitigate expectations and require specific approaches. We demonstrate how NN-models, pretrained on a global time series database, can be applied to customer specific data using transfer learning. In general, NN-models adequately operate only on stationary time series. Application to nonstationary time series requires multilayer data processing including hypothesis testing for data categorization, category specific transformations into stationary data, forecasting and backward transformations. We present the mathematical background of this approach and discuss experimental results based on implementation for Wavefront by VMware (an APM software) while monitoring real customer cloud environments.},

Let M be a triangulated, orientable 2-manifold of genus g without boundary, and let h be a height function over M that is linear within each triangle. We present a kinetic data structure (KDS) for 
maintaining the Reeb graph R of h as the heights of M's vertices vary continuously with time. Assuming the heights of two vertices of M become equal only O(1) times, the KDS processes O((k + g) n {\textbackslash}polylog n) events; n is the number of vertices in M, and k is the number of external events which change the combinatorial structure of R. Each event is processed in O({\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}2 n) time, and the total size of our KDS is O(gn). The KDS can be extended to maintain an augmented Reeb graph as well.},

	abstract = {Object
              The extent of resection (EOR) is a known prognostic factor in patients with glioblastoma. However, gross-total resection (GTR) is not always achieved. Understanding the factors that prevent GTR is helpful in surgical planning and when counseling patients. The goal of this study was to identify demographic, tumor-related, and technical factors that influence EOR and to define the relationship between the surgeon's impression of EOR and radiographically determined EOR.
            
            
              Methods
              The authors performed a retrospective review of the electronic medical records to identify all patients who underwent craniotomy for glioblastoma resection between 2006 and 2009 and who had both preoperative and postoperative MRI studies. Forty-six patients were identified and were included in the study. Image analysis software (FIJI) was used to perform volumetric analysis of tumor size and EOR based on preoperative and postoperative MRI. Using multivariate analysis, the authors assessed factors associated with EOR and residual tumor volume. Perception of resectability was described using bivariate statistics, and survival was described using the log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier curves.
            
            
              Results
              The EOR was less for tumors in eloquent areas (p = 0.014) and those touching ventricles (p = 0.031). Left parietal tumors had significantly greater residual volume (p = 0.042). The average EOR was 91.0\% in this series. There was MRI-demonstrable residual tumor in 69.6\% of cases (16 of 23) in which GTR was perceived by the surgeon. Expert reviewers agreed that GTR could be safely achieved in 37.0\% of patients (17 of 46) in this series. Among patients with safely resectable tumors, radiographically complete resection was achieved in 23.5\% of patients (4 of 17). An EOR greater than 90\% was associated with a significantly greater 1-year survival (76.5\%) than an EOR less than 90\% (p = 0.005).
            
            
              Conclusions
              The authors' findings confirm that tumor location affects EOR and suggest that EOR may also be influenced by the surgeon's ability to judge the presence of residual tumor during surgery. The surgeon's ability to judge completeness of resection during surgery is commonly inaccurate. The authors' study confirms the impact of EOR on 1-year survival.},

              Motivation
              High throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) has become exceedingly cheap, facilitating studies to be undertaken containing large sample numbers. Quality control (QC) is an essential stage during analytic pipelines and the outputs of popular bioinformatics tools such as FastQC and Picard can provide information on individual samples. Although these tools provide considerable power when carrying out QC, large sample numbers can make inspection of all samples and identification of systemic bias a challenge.
            
            
              Results
              We present ngsReports, an R package designed for the management and visualization of NGS reports from within an R environment. The available methods allow direct import into R of FastQC reports along with outputs from other tools. Visualization can be carried out across many samples using default, highly customizable plots with options to perform hierarchical clustering to quickly identify outlier libraries. Moreover, these can be displayed in an interactive shiny app or HTML report for ease of analysis.
            
            
              Availability and implementation
              The ngsReports package is available on Bioconductor and the GUI shiny app is available at https://github.com/UofABioinformaticsHub/shinyNgsreports.
            
            
              Supplementary information

	abstract = {The purpose of this research was to evaluate the interaction of left-turn and opposing through traffic volumes for permitted and protected left-turn phasing at intersections and develop boundaries that help identify when to switch from permitted to protected phasing at signalized intersections. Permitted phasing allows vehicles to turn left after yielding to opposing vehicles; protected phasing provides an exclusive phase for vehicles to turn left without opposition; and protected-permitted phasing combines these phasing alternatives, allowing both permitted and protected turning movements. Intersections with 1, 2, and 3 opposing-lane configurations with permitted and protected-permitted models (split into green times of 10, 15, and 20 s) were analyzed for a total of 12 simulation models. Each model was divided into 100–225 different volume scenarios, with incremental increases in left-turn and opposing volumes. By exporting trajectory files from VISSIM and importing these into the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model, crossing conflicts for each volume combination in each model were extracted. MATLAB was then used to create contour maps representing the number of crossing conflicts per hour associated with different combinations of left-turn and opposing volume. Basic decision boundaries were examined in each contour map. Statistical analysis software was used to perform a linear regression analysis on transformed data and to develop natural log-based equations that form the decision boundaries for each configuration and phase alternative. These equations were graphed and final decision boundaries developed for the 1-, 2-, and 3-lane configurations between permitted and protected-permitted phasing as well as between protected-permitted and protected phasing.},

	abstract = {This article deals with the topic of modelling the log-yard of one of our industry partners. To this end, our framework is based on discrete-events modelling (DEM), as consequence that many stages of the process run as a sequence of events. The sequence starts when trucks, trains or ships arrive loaded with logs to the log-yard. A machine unloads these logs and accumulates them in different storage areas. Consequently, a machine transports logs from these areas to the pulp mill, thus finishing the process. As using probability density functions is the core concept of DEM, the necessary process data to build these PDFs have been partly provided by the company. Other necessary data have been acquired through time studies, and by defining operational requirements. The company data tell when trucks, trains, or ships arrive to the log-yard, and the amount of volume they carry. The objective is to develop the necessary formulations, model calibration techniques, and software, such that computer simulations reproduce the quantities observed in these data. To this end, this work suggests two alternatives to analyse the data itself. These two alternatives lead to two different models: (1) The first being a hybrid model, in the sense that it involves the events in the process, and the logic decisions taken by machine operators for handling the incoming load, and (2) the second containing only the main mathematical essence of the process. After running 100 simulations, both mathematical models show that the simulated values for input and output, in terms of transport units and their volume, differ only by less than 3\% compared to company data. The first model has also shown the ability to replicate the decision making that a machine operator undergoes for driving the logs to the storage areas, and from there to the mill. Therefore, the framework adopted provides the necessary mathematical tools and data analysis to model the log-yard and obtain highly reliable results via simulations.},

	abstract = {Background
              There is a paucity of quantitative evidence in the current literature on the incidence of wrong medication and wrong dose administration of intravenous medications by clinicians. The difficulties of obtaining reliable data are related to the fact that at this stage of the medication administration chain, detection of errors is extremely difficult. Smart pump medication library logs and their reporting software record medication and dose selections made by users, as well as cancellations of selections and the time between these actions. Analysis of these data adds quantitative data to the detection of these kinds of errors.
            
            
              Objective
              We aimed to establish, in a reproducible and reliable study, baseline data to show how metrics in the set-up and programming phase of intravenous medication administration can be produced from medication library near-miss error reports from infusion pumps.
            
            
              Methods
              We performed a 12-month retrospective review of medication library reports from infusion pumps from across a facility to obtain metrics on the set-up phase of intravenous medication administration. Cancelled infusions and resolutions of all infusion alerts by users were analyzed. Decision times of clinicians were calculated from the time-date stamps of the pumps’ logs.
            
            
              Results
              Incorrect medication selections represented 3.45\%  (10,017/290,807) of all medication library alerts and 22.40\% (10,017/44,721) of all cancelled infusions. Of these cancelled medications, all high-risk medications, oncology medications, and all intravenous medications delivered to pediatric patients and neonates required a two-nurse check according to the local policy. Wrong dose selection was responsible for 2.93\% (8533/290,807) of all alarms and 19.08\% (8533/44,721) of infusion cancellations. Average error recognition to cancellation and correction times were 27.00 s (SD 22.25) for medication error correction and 26.52 s (SD 24.71) for dose correction. The mean character count of medications corrected from initial lookalike-soundalike selection errors was 13.04, with a heavier distribution toward higher character counts. The position of the word/phrase error was spread among name beginning (6991/10,017, 69.79\%), middle (2144/10,017, 21.40\%), and end (882/10,017, 8.80\%).
            
            
              Conclusions
              The study identified a high number of lookalike-soundalike near miss errors, with cancellation of one medication being rapidly followed by the programming of a second. This phenomenon was largely centered on initial misreadings of the beginning of the medication name, with some incidences of misreading in the middle and end portions of medication nomenclature. The value of an infusion pump showing the entire medication name complete with TALLman lettering on the interface matching that of medication labeling is supported by these findings. The study provides a quantitative appraisal of an area that has been resistant to study and measurement, which is the number of intravenous medication administration errors of wrong medication and wrong dose that occur in clinical settings.},

	abstract = {Objective: Recurrent events data is one of the most important types of survival data whose main feature is correlation between individual’s observations. The aim of this study was to analyze the time to bipolar disorder (BD) relapse and determine the related factors using recurrent events models.
Method: In this retrospective study, records of 104 BD patients with at least one relapse who were admitted for the first time (2001-2015) in Farabi hospital of Kermanshah were gathered to identify the factors influencing the time intervals between the recurrent survivals data using the Cox model with and without frailty (shared frailty), once with frailty gamma distribution and once with log-normal distribution frailty. All calculations were performed using R and SPSS software, versions 3.0.2 and 16 and the level of significance was considered at 0.05.
Results: Among the employed models, Cox model with lognormal shared frailty showed better fit for BD recurrent survival data. According to results of Cox model with lognormal frailty, 2 factors (marital status and history of veteran) were identified to affect the time intervals between relapses.
Conclusion: Because of the better fit of the models with the frailty effect on data, the correlation between the recurrent time intervals of each subject's relapse of BD was confirmed. Also, since the risk of subsequent relapses was less in married and veteran patients, marriage and emotional care supports can be considered as effective factors in reducing the risk of subsequent relapses of this disease.},

              We provide a dataset of 3D coordinate time series of 37 continuous GNSS stations installed for stability monitoring purposes on onshore and offshore industrial settlements along a NW-SE-oriented and {\textasciitilde}100-km-wide belt encompassing the eastern Italian coast and the Adriatic Sea. The dataset results from the analysis performed by using different geodetic software (Bernese, GAMIT/GLOBK and GIPSY) and consists of six raw position time series solutions, referred to IGb08 and IGS14 reference frames. Time series analyses and comparisons evidence that the different solutions are consistent between them, despite the use of different software, models, strategy processing and frame realizations. We observe that the offshore stations are subject to significant seasonal oscillations probably due to seasonal environmental loads, seasonal temperature-induced platform deformation and hydrostatic pressure variations. Many stations are characterized by non-linear time series, suggesting a complex interplay between regional (long-term tectonic stress) and local sources of deformation (e.g. reservoirs depletion, sediment compaction). Computed raw time series, logs files, phasor diagrams and time series comparison plots are distributed via PANGAEA (

This study examines the reaction time and the results of the male and female sprinters participating in the World Athletics Championships from 2011 to 2019 in the 100 m, 200 m, 100 m, and 110 m hurdles. The researchers used least squares estimation, multivariate analysis of variance, and other methods and theories to construct a double logarithmic model and a multivariate analysis of a variance model. The researchers used Econometrics Views and SPSS software programs to analyze the correlation between the performance and the starting reaction time, as well as the patterns in the changes of the reaction time of athletes of both genders in different types of and rounds in the competitions. Research results show that there is a direct correlation between the reaction time and the performance, and the degrees of correlation vary depending on the gender of the athlete, year of competition, type of competition, and round of competition. There is a correlation between the foul types and the type of competition, but there is no correlation between foul types and the gender of the athlete. The research results are science-based and are of practical value and thus can be used as a reference by coaches in sprint running to offer more professional guidance to the athletes.},

              To examine the association between polarity of atrial premature complexes (APCs) and stroke.
            
            
              Design
              A prospective study.
            
            
              Setting and participants
              A total of 11 092 participants in the Jichi Medical School cohort study were included after excluding patients with atrial fibrillation. We analysed stroke events in patients with (n=136) and without (n=10 956) APCs. With regard to polarity of APCs, patients were subcategorised into having (1) negative (n=39) or non-negative (n=97) P waves in augmented vector right (aVR), and (2) positive (n=28) or non-positive (n=108) P waves in augmented vector left (aVL).
            
            
              Outcome measures
              The primary endpoint was stroke.
            
            
              Results
              Patients with APCs were significantly older than those without APCs (64.1±9.2 vs 55.1±11.6 years, p{\textless}0.001). The mean follow-up period was 11.8±2.4 years. Stroke events were observed in patients with (n=13 events) and without (n=411 events) APCs. This difference was significant (log-rank 12.9, p{\textless}0.001); however, APCs were not an independent predictor of stroke after adjusting for age, sex, height, body mass index, current drinking, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, prior myocardial infarction, prior stroke and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p=0.15). The incidence of stroke in patients with APCs and non-negative P wave in aVR was significantly higher than in patients without APCs (log-rank 20.1, p{\textless}0.001), and non-negative P wave in aVR was revealed to be an independent predictor of stroke (HR 1.84, 95\% CI 1.02 to 3.30). The incidence of stroke in patients with APC with non-positive P wave in aVL was also significantly higher than in patients without APC (log-rank 15.3, p{\textless}0.001), and non-positive P wave in aVL was an independent predictor of stroke (HR 1.92, 95\% CI 1.05 to 3.54).
            
            
              Conclusions
              The presence of APCs with non-negative P wave in aVR or non-positive P wave in aVL on 12-lead ECG was associated with a higher risk of incident stroke.},

              Background
              With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. Data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes.
            
            
              Methods
              A retrospective review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into 3 disease severity groups (nonsevere, severe, and critical), based on initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify risk factors associated with clinical outcomes, and log-rank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression.
            
            
              Results
              Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement in patient outcomes. By univariate logistic regression analysis, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Multivariate regression indicated age \&gt;65 years (P \&lt; .001), smoking (P = .001), critical disease status (P = .002), diabetes (P = .025), high hypersensitive troponin I (\&gt;0.04 pg/mL, P = .02), leukocytosis (\&gt;10 × 109/L, P \&lt; .001), and neutrophilia (\&gt;75 × 109/L, P \&lt; .001) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. In contrast, the administration of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes (P \&lt; .001), which was confirmed by survival analysis.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Hypnotics may be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19. We also found novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes. Overall, our study provides useful data to guide early clinical decision making to reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes of COVID-19.},

              Background
              Although chlamydia (CT) and gonorrhea (GC) infections are increasing in the United States, there are limited data on their incidence, testing rates, and associated risk factors among persons living with HIV (PLWH), including by anatomic site among men who have sex with men (MSM).
            
            
              Methods
              We analyzed 2007–2017 medical records data from Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Outpatient Study (HOPS) participants in care at 9 HIV clinics. We calculated CT (and GC) incidence and testing rates and assessed associations with sociodemographic and clinical factors using log-linear regression.
            
            
              Results
              Among 4727 PLWH, 397 had 881 CT infections and 331 had 861 GC infections, with an incidence of 2.95 and 2.88 per 100 person-years, respectively. From 2007 to 2017, incidence and testing rates increased by approximately 3.0- and 1.9-fold for CT and GC, respectively. Multivariable factors associated with incident CT (GC) included younger age, MSM, and prior diagnoses of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Among 1159 MSM, 583 (50.3\%) had 844 CT and 843 GC tests during 2016–2017, and 26.6\% of tests were 3-site (urethra, rectum, and pharynx), yielding the highest rates of CT (GC) detection. Multivariable factors associated with CT (GC) testing included younger age, non-Hispanic/Latino black race, and having prior STDs.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Recent CT and GC incidence and testing increased among PLWH; however, only half of MSM were tested for CT or GC during 2016–2017 and less than a third of tests were 3-site. To promote sexual health and STD prevention among PLWH who are MSM, research regarding the added value of CT and GC testing across 3 anatomic sites is needed.},

	doi = {10.1177/1740774520905563},
	abstract = {Background/aims:
              The difference in mean survival time, which quantifies the treatment effect in terms most meaningful to patients and retains its interpretability regardless of the shape of the survival distribution or the proportionality of the treatment effect, is an alternative endpoint that could be used more often as the primary endpoint to design clinical trials. The underuse of this endpoint is due to investigators’ lack of familiarity with the test comparing the mean survival times and the lack of tools to facilitate trial design with this endpoint. The aim of this article is to provide investigators with insights and software to design trials with restricted mean survival time as the primary endpoint.
            
            
              Methods:
              A closed-form formula for the asymptotic power of the test of restricted mean survival time difference is presented. The effects of design parameters on power were evaluated for the mean survival time test and log-rank test. An R package which calculates the power or the sample size for user-specified parameter values and provides power plots for each design parameter is provided. The R package also calculates the probability that the restricted mean survival time is estimable for user-defined trial designs.
            
            
              Results:
              Under proportional hazards and late differences in survival, the power of the mean survival time test can approach that of the log-rank test if the restriction time is late. Under early differences, the power of the restricted mean survival time test is higher than that of the log-rank test. Duration of accrual and follow-up have little influence on the power of the restricted mean survival time test. The choice of restriction time, on the other hand, has a large impact on power. Because the power depends on the interplay among the design factors, plotting the relationship between each design parameter and power allows the users to select the designs most appropriate for their trial. When modification is necessary to ensure the difference in restricted mean survival time is estimable, the three available modifications all perform adequately in the scenarios studied.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              The restricted mean survival time is a survival endpoint that is meaningful to investigators and to patients and at the same time requires less restrictive assumptions. The biggest challenge with this endpoint is selection of the restriction time. We recommend selecting a restriction time that is clinically relevant to the disease and the clinical setting of the trial of interest. The practical considerations and the R package provided in this work are readily available tools that researchers can use to design trials with restricted mean survival time as the primary endpoint.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE
              The Electronic Medical Record Search Engine (EMERSE) is a software tool built to aid research spanning cohort discovery, population health, and data abstraction for clinical trials. EMERSE is now live at three academic medical centers, with additional sites currently working on implementation. In this report, we describe how EMERSE has been used to support cancer research based on a variety of metrics.
            
            
              METHODS
              We identified peer-reviewed publications that used EMERSE through online searches as well as through direct e-mails to users based on audit logs. These logs were also used to summarize use at each of the three sites. Search terms for two of the sites were characterized using the natural language processing tool MetaMap to determine to which semantic types the terms could be mapped.
            
            
              RESULTS
              We identified a total of 326 peer-reviewed publications that used EMERSE through August 2019, although this is likely an underestimation of the true total based on the use log analysis. Oncology-related research comprised nearly one third (n = 105; 32.2\%) of all research output. The use logs showed that EMERSE had been used by multiple people at each site (nearly 3,500 across all three) who had collectively logged into the system {\textgreater} 100,000 times. Many user-entered search queries could not be mapped to a semantic type, but the most common semantic type for terms that did match was “disease or syndrome,” followed by “pharmacologic substance.”
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              EMERSE has been shown to be a valuable tool for supporting cancer research. It has been successfully deployed at other sites, despite some implementation challenges unique to each deployment environment.},

	abstract = {Background
              Western countries report a significant increase in the proportion of patients who experience out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) and benefit from a public automated external defibrillator (pAED) before the arrival of rescue teams. However, recordings of devices recovered after resuscitation are of variable quality. Analysis of these data may inform decisions of whether to implement an internal defibrillator for survivors, and provide useful information about the performance of pAED algorithms and the actions of bystanders.
            
            
              Objective
              To investigate the quality of the information recorded by pAEDs during OHCAs in the Paris area.
            
            
              Methods
              pAED files used for some of the 8629 OHCAs that occurred in the greater Paris area between 1 January 2017 and 31 April 2019 on the day of the arrest were collected. The presence and accuracy of 23 factors required to interpret the recording was noted, including readability of the ECG, the presence of an impedance curve and the accuracy of the date and time. The recordings were analysed to assess the diagnostic and therapeutic performance of the pAEDs used.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 258 patients with an OHCA received assistance from a pAED, and 182 recordings were recovered. The pAEDs were made by 12 different manufacturers. Data extraction required eight different transmission modes and 16 software programmes; recordings were of highly heterogeneous quality. Two per cent of the recordings were of such poor quality that they were not interpretable. Among the 98\% remaining, only 43\% included a thoracic impedance curve, 34\% the intensity of the shocks delivered and 8\% the patient name. The date and time were accurate in 68\% and 48\% of recordings, respectively. The pAEDs had 87.6\% (95\% CI 83.7\% to 91.0\%) sensitivity and 99.5\% (99.5\% to 99.5\%) specificity for defibrillating shockable rhythms (positive predictive value 98.2\% (96.4\% to 99.0\%), negative predictive value 96.4\% (95.3\% to 96.8\%)). The absence of important variables prevented the analysis of approximately half of the inappropriate decisions made by pAEDs.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Collection of pAED recordings is a major challenge. Their analysis is compromised by heterogeneity and poor quality (incomplete maintenance records, patient details and logs). AED recordings are currently the most relevant resource to track pAED performance and bystander practices. The quality of these recordings needs to improve.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            During July 2019, a sequence of earthquakes, including an Mw 6.4 foreshock and an Mw 7.1 mainshock, occurred near Ridgecrest, California. ShakeAlert, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) earthquake early warning system being developed for the U.S. West Coast, was operational during this time, although public alerting was only available within Los Angeles County. ShakeAlert created alert messages for the two largest events and for many of the larger aftershocks. In this study, we dissect log files and replay data through the system to reconstruct the sequence of events and analyze the performance of the system during that period. Although the system performed reasonably well overall, the sequence also revealed various issues and short comings that will be addressed in impending and future system upgrades. ShakeAlert detected and characterized both the Mw 6.4 and Mw 7.1 earthquakes within 6.9 s of their origin times and created alert messages that were available to ShakeAlert’s pilot users. No public alerts were sent out by the ShakeAlertLA cell phone app (the only publicly available alerting method at the time), because the predicted shaking for Los Angeles County was below the app’s alerting threshold of modified Mercalli intensity 4.0. For the Mw 6.4 event, this was accurate. For the Mw 7.1 event, public alerts for Los Angeles County were warranted, but ShakeAlert underpredicted the shaking levels, because both the point-source and finite-fault algorithms underestimated the magnitude of the earthquake by 0.8 units. A number of software and hardware issues that were responsible for the magnitude underestimation of the mainshock have been identified and will be addressed in future ShakeAlert releases. We also analyze the hypothetical alerting performance of ShakeAlert had public alerting been available throughout southern California.},

	abstract = {Radiological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is currently used to assess the efficacy of treatment in pediatric patients with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), but the association between early tumor response on imaging and survival is still controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of assessing radiological response after induction therapy in pediatric RMS, comparing four different methods. This retrospective, two-center study was conducted on 66 non-metastatic RMS patients. Two radiologists measured tumor size on pre- and post-treatment magnetic resonance (MR) or computed tomography (CT) images using four methods: considering maximal diameter with the 1D-RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors); multiplying the two maximal diameters with the 2D-WHO (World Health Organization); multiplying the three maximal diameters with the 3D-EpSSG (European pediatric Soft tissue sarcoma Study Group); obtaining a software-assisted volume assessment with the 3D-Osirix. Each patient was classified as a responder or non-responder based on the proposed thresholds for each method. Tumor response was compared with survival using Kaplan–Meier plots, the log-rank test, and Cox’s regression. Agreement between methods and observers (weighted-κ) was also calculated. The 5-year event-free survival (5yr-EFS) calculated with the Kaplan–Meier plots was significantly longer for responders than for non-responders with all the methods, but the 3D assessments differentiated between the two groups better than the 1D-RECIST or 2D-WHO (p1D-RECIST = 0.018, p2D-WHO = 0.007, p3D-EpSSG and p3D-Osirix {\textless} 0.0001). Comparing the 5yr-EFS of responders and non-responders also produced adjusted hazard ratios of 3.57 (p = 0.0158) for the 1D-RECIST, 5.05 for the 2D-WHO (p = 0.0042), 14.40 for the 3D-EpSSG (p {\textless} 0.0001) and 11.60 for the 3D-Osirix (p {\textless} 0.0001), indicating that the volumetric measurements were significantly more strongly associated with EFS. Inter-method agreement was excellent between the 3D-EpSSG and the 3D-Osirix (κ = 0.98), and moderate for the other comparisons (0.5 {\textless} κ {\textless} 0.8). The 1D-RECIST and the 2D-WHO tended to underestimate response to treatment. Inter-observer agreement was excellent with all methods (κ {\textgreater} 0.8) except for the 2D-WHO (κ = 0.7). In conclusion, early tumor response was confirmed as a significant prognostic factor in RMS, and the 3D-EpSSG and 3D-Osirix methods predicted response to treatment better than the 1D-RECIST or 2D-WHO measurements.},

              The sample of serendipitous sources detected in all
              Swift
              -XRT images pointing at gamma ray bursts (GRBs) constitutes the largest existing medium-deep survey of the X-ray sky. To build such dataset we analysed all
              Swift
              X-ray images centred on GRBs and observed over a period of 15 years using automatic tools that do not require any expertise in X-ray astronomy. Besides presenting a new large X-ray survey and a complete sample of blazars, this work aims to be a step in the direction of achieving the ultimate goal of the Open Universe Initiative, which is to enable non-expert people to benefit fully from space science data, possibly extending the potential for scientific discovery, which is currently confined within a small number of highly specialised teams, to a much larger population.
            
            
              Methods.
              We used the
              Swift
              \_deepsky Docker container encapsulated pipeline to build the largest existing flux-limited and unbiased sample of serendipitous X-ray sources.
              Swift
              \_deepsky runs on any laptop or desktop computer with a modern operating system. The tool automatically downloads the data and the calibration files from the archives, runs the official
              Swift
              analysis software, and produces a number of results including images, the list of detected sources, X-ray fluxes, spectral energy distribution data, and spectral slope estimations.
            
            
              Results.
              We used our source list to build the LogN-LogS of extra-galactic sources, which perfectly matches that estimated by other satellites. Combining our survey with multi-frequency data, we selected a complete radio-flux-density-limited sample of high energy peaked blazars (HBL). The LogN-LogS built with this data set confirms that previous samples are incomplete below ∼20 mJy.},

            Understanding the local stratigraphy and geometry of sediment units is necessary for successful 3D modelling and the prediction of ground behaviour and engineering-geological properties for urban land use and construction. A detailed 3D model of the main sediment units for the Rastaala basin in southern coastal Finland was constructed, combining a conceptual geological model and information from local drill-hole logs and geotechnical drilling. The 3D modelling was based on a cross-section approach, where sediment units were defined on the basis of lithological boundaries that are of major geotechnical importance for land use and construction. The conceptual geological model was based on a sequence of events that characterize the late- and postglacial evolution of the Rastaala basin. The present study combines the allostratigraphy and lithostratigraphy of unconsolidated glacial, late-and postglacial sediment units in southern coastal Finland. It also investigates the appearance and distribution of sediment units in the Rastaala basin and compares modelling and visualization results for unit surfaces and solids using two independent modelling software packages. Finally, information on the geotechnical properties of different sediment units in the Rastaala basin is provided so that they can be applied to other onshore regions with similar geological settings in the coastal Baltic Sea Basin.},

In this article, a novel approach is presented to tackle the challenge of computing an alignment for large-problem instances that correspond to well-formed process models. Given an observed trace, first it uses a novel replay technique to find an initial candidate trace in the model. Then a local search framework is applied to try to improve the alignment until no further improvement is possible. The implementation of the presented technique reveals a magnificent reduction both in computation time and in memory usage. Moreover, although the proposed technique does not guarantee the derivation of an alignment with minimal cost, the experiments show that in practice the quality of the obtained solutions is close to optimal.},

              Whether medication optimisation improves clinical outcomes in elderly individuals remains unclear. The current study aims to evaluate the effect of multidisciplinary team-based medication optimisation on survival, rehospitalisation and unscheduled hospital visits in elderly patients.
            
            
              Methods and analysis
              We report the protocol of a single-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial. The enrolled subjects will be medical inpatients, aged 65 years or older, admitted to a community hospital and receiving five or more regular medications. The participants will be randomly assigned to receive either an intervention for medication optimisation or the usual care. The intervention will consist of a multidisciplinary team-based medication review, followed by a medication optimisation proposal based on the Screening Tool of Older Persons’ potentially inappropriate Prescriptions/Screening Tool to Alert doctors to the Right Treatment criteria and an implicit medication optimisation protocol. Medication optimisation summaries will be sent to primary care physicians and community pharmacists on discharge. The primary outcome will be a composite of death, unscheduled hospital visits and rehospitalisation until 48 weeks after randomisation. Secondary outcomes will include each of the primary endpoints, the number of prescribed medications, quality of life score, level of long-term care required, drug-related adverse events, death during hospitalisation and falls. Participants will be followed up for 48 weeks with bimonthly telephone interviews to assess the primary and secondary outcomes. A log-rank test stratified by randomisation factors will be used to compare the incidence of the composite endpoint. The study was initiated in 2019 and a minimum of 500 patients will be enrolled.
            
            
              Ethics and dissemination
              The study protocol has been approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee of St. Marianna University School of Medicine (No. 4129). The results of the current study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.

	doi = {10.1177/0004563218806560},
	abstract = {Background
              Bland–Altman analysis is a popular and widely used method for assessing the level of agreement between two analytical methods. An important assumption is that paired method differences exhibit approximately constant (homogeneous) scatter when plotted against pair means. This allows estimation of limits of agreement which retain validity across the entire range of mean values. In practice, pair differences often increase systematically with the mean and Bland and Altman used log transformed data to achieve approximately homogeneous scatter. Unfortunately, a logarithmic transformation fails when data are located near the detection limit of an assay (a region that is often of considerable clinical importance).
            
            
              Methods
              Simulated thyrotropin data are used to illustrate how a variance function, estimated from pair differences, can be used to transform problematic data into a form suitable for traditional Bland–Altman analysis. Simulated and real data sets are used in a supplementary file to illustrate and offer practical solutions to potential problems.
            
            
              Results
              Following transformation by variance function, Bland–Altman results can be readily interpreted by back-transformation either to the original measurement scale or as percentage values. Limits of agreement are no longer horizontal straight lines, but their shapes simply reflect error characteristics which are (or should be) thoroughly familiar to laboratory analysts.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The method is completely general and in principle requires only the estimation of a variance function that reliably describes the relationship between the variances of pair differences and their mean values. A computer program is available which performs the necessary calculations.},

              Background
              Malnutrition is still a global public health problem contributing for under-five morbidity and mortality. The case is similar in Ethiopia in which severe acute malnutrition is the major contributor to mortality being an underlying cause for nearly 45\% of under-five deaths. However, there is no recent evidence that shows the time to death and public health importance of oxygen saturation and chest in drawing in the study area. Therefore, estimated time to death and its predictors can provide an input for program planners and decision-makers.
            
            
              Methods
              
                A facility -based retrospective cohort study was conducted among 488 severe acute malnourished under-five children admitted from the 1st of January 2016 to the 30th of December 2019. The study participants were selected by using simple random sampling technique. Data were entered in to Epi-Data version 3.1 and exported to STATA version15 statistical software for further analysis. The Kaplan Meier was used to estimate cumulative survival probability and a log-rank test was used to compare the survival time between different categories of explanatory variables. The Cox-proportional hazard regression model was fitted to identify predictors of mortality.
                P
                -value{\textless} 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance.
              
            
            
              Results
              Out of the total 488 randomly selected charts of children with severe acute malnutrition, 476 records were included in the final analysis. A total of 54(11.34\%) children died with an incidence rate of 9.1death /1000 person- days. Failed appetite test (AHR: 2.4; 95\%CI: 1.26, 4.67), altered consciousness level at admission (AHR: 2.4; 95\%CI: 1.08, 4.67), oxygen saturation below 90\% (AHR: 3.3; 95\%CI: 1.40, 7.87), edema (AHR 2.9; 95\%CI: 1.45, 5.66) and HIV infection (AHR: 2.8; 95\%CI: 1.24, 6.36) were predictors of mortality for children diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The overall survival status of severe acute malnourished children was low as compared to national sphere standards and previous reports in the literature. The major predictors of mortality were oxygen saturation below 90\%, altered consciousness, HIV infection, edema and failed appetite test. Therefore, early screening of complications, close follow up and regular monitoring of sever acute malnourished children might improve child survival rate.},

	doi = {10.3390/diagnostics9010016},
	abstract = {Background: While left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) has been shown to have prognostic value in ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICMX) patients, right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) has not been systematically evaluated in either ICMX or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICMX) patients. Moreover, an accurate estimation of RVEF is problematic due to the geometry of the right ventricle (RV). Over the years, there have been improvements in the resolution, image acquisition and post-processing software for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), such that CMR has become the “gold standard” for measuring RV volumetrics and RVEF. We hypothesize that CMR defines RVEF more so than LVEF and might have prognostic capabilities in ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy patients (ICMX and NICMX). Methods: Patients that underwent CMR at our institution between January 2005 and October 2012 were retrospectively selected if three-dimensional (3D) LVEF {\textless} 35\%. Patients were further divided into ICMX and NICMX groups. The electronic medical record (EMR) database inquiry determined all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Additionally, a Social Security Death Index (SSI) database inquiry was performed to determine all-cause mortality in patients who were lost to follow-up. Patients were further sub-grouped on the basis of 3D RVEF ≥ 20\%. Separately, patients were sub-grouped by LVEF ≥ 20\% in both ICMX and NICMX cases. A cut-off of ≥20\% was chosen for the RVEF based on the results of prior studies showing significance based on Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival curves. Cumulative event rates were estimated for each subgroup using the KM analysis and were compared using the log-rank test. The 3D RV/LVEFs were compared to all-cause mortality and MACE. ICMX patients were defined using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Results: From a 7000-patient CMR database, 753 heart failure patients were selected. Eighty-seven patients met WHO definition of ICMX and NICMX (43 ICMX and 44 NICMX). The study patients were followed for a median of 3 years (Interquartile range or IQR 1.5–6.5 years). The mean age of patients was 58 ± 13 years; 79\% were male. In ICMX, mean 3D LVEF was 21\% ± 6\% and mean 3D RVEF was 38\% ± 14\%, while for NICMX, mean 3D LVEF was 16\% ± 6\% and mean 3D RVEF was 30\% ± 14\% (p {\textless} 0.005 for intra- and inter-group comparison). It should be noted that LVEF {\textless} RVEF in both groups and the ejection fraction (EF) in NICMX was less than the corresponding EF in ICMX. Overall mortality was higher in ICMX than NICMX (12/40, 30\% vs. 7/43, 16\%; p {\textless} 0.05). Patients were stratified based on both RVEF and LVEF with a threshold of EF ≥ 20\% separately. RVEF but not LVEF was a significant predictor of death for NICMX (χ2 = 8; p {\textless} 0.005), while LVEF did not predict death in ICMX (χ2 = 2, p = not significant). Similarly, time to MACE was predicted by RVEF for NICMX (χ2 = 9; p {\textless} 0.005) but not by LVEF in ICMX (χ2 = 1; p = NS). Importantly, RVEF, while predictive of NICMX MACE, did not emerge as a predictor of survival or MACE in ICMX. Conclusions: Via 3D CMR in non-ischemic CMX patients, RVEF has important value in predicting death and time to first MACE while 3D LVEF is far less predictive.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              Libraries throughout the world use OCLC’s EZproxy software to manage access to e-resources. When cleaned, processed, visualized and enhanced, these logs paint a valuable picture of a library’s impact on researcher’s lives. The purpose of this paper is to share techniques and procedures for enhancing and de-identifying EZproxy logs using Tableau, a data analytics and visualization software, and Tableau Prep, a tool used for cleaning, combining and shaping data for analysis.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              In February 2018, The Ohio State University Libraries established an automated daily process to extract and clean EZproxy log files. The assessment librarian created a series of procedures in Tableau and Tableau Prep to union, parse and enhance these files by adding information such as user major, user status (faculty, graduate or undergraduate) and the title of the requested resource. She last stripped the data set of identifiers and applied best practices for maintaining confidentiality to visualize the data.
            
            
              Findings
              The data set is currently 1.5m rows and growing. The visualizations may be filtered by date, user status and user department/major where applicable. Safeguards are in place to limit data presentation when filters might reveal a user’s identity.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Tableau used in concert with Tableau Prep allows an assessment librarian to clean and combine data from various sources. Once procedures for cleaning and combining data sources are established, the data driving visualizations can be set to refresh on a set schedule. This expedites the ability of librarians to derive actionable insights from EZproxy data and to share the library’s positive impact on researcher’s lives.},

              The purpose of this paper is to develop data visualisation proof of concept prototypes that will enable the Curtin University Library team to explore its users’ information-seeking behaviour and collection use online by analysing the library’s EZproxy logs.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Curtin Library’s EZproxy log file data from 2013 to 2017 is used to develop the data visualisation prototypes using Unity3D software.
            
            
              Findings
              Two visualisation prototypes from the EZproxy data set are developed. The first, “Global Visualisation of Curtin Research Activity”, uses a geographical map of the world as a platform to show where each research request comes from, the time each is made and the file size of the request. The second prototype, “Database Usage Visualisation”, shows the use of the library’s various subscription databases by staff and students daily, over a month in April 2017.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              The paper has following limitations: working to a tight timeline of ten weeks; time taken to cleanse noise data; and requirements for storing and hosting the voluminous data sets.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The prototypes provide visual evidence of the use of Curtin Library’s digital resources at any time and from anywhere by its users, demonstrating the demand for the library’s online service offerings. These prototype evidence-based data visualisations empower the library to communicate in a compelling and interesting way how its services and subscriptions support Curtin University’s missions.

              Aims
              Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) with left ventricular apical aneurysm (LVAA) is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. However, the clinical significance of LVAA in apical HCM (ApHCM) has not been reported. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) characteristics, and prognosis of LVAA in ApHCM patients.
            
            
              Methods and results
              A total of 1332 consecutive ApHCM patients confirmed by CMR in our hospital were retrospectively analysed. LVAAs were identified in 31 patients of all ApHCM patients (2.3\%, 31/1332). Besides, 31 age- and gender-matched ApHCM patients without LVAA were used for comparison. Of the 31 aneurysm patients (mean age, 53.8 ± 15.1 years old), 28 (90.3\%) had clinical symptoms, and 3 (9.7\%) had a family history of HCM. The rate of missed diagnosis of echocardiography for detecting LVAA was 64.5\% (20/31), most (90\%, 18/20) of unidentified LVAAs by echocardiography were small aneurysms (\&lt;20 mm). Compared with ApHCM patients without LVAA, the proportion of systolic mid-cavity obstruction and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) presence, and the LGE extent in ApHCM patients with LVAA were significantly higher (all P\&lt;0.05). The Kaplan–Meier curves showed that the event-free survival rate in ApHCM patients with LVAA was significantly lower than that in ApHCM patients without LVAA (log rank, P = 0.010).
            
            
              Conclusion
              ApHCM with LVAA is a very rare condition, which is often missed by echocardiography and could be reliably detected with CMR and is associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events compared with ApHCM without LVAA.},

              Background
              A common approach for sequencing studies is to do joint-calling and store variants of all samples in a single file. If new samples are continually added or controls are re-used for several studies, the cost and time required to perform joint-calling for each analysis can become prohibitive.
            
            
              Results
              We present ATAV, an analysis platform for large-scale whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing projects. ATAV stores variant and per site coverage data for all samples in a centralized database, which is efficiently queried by ATAV to support diagnostic analyses for trios and singletons, as well as rare-variant collapsing analyses for finding disease associations in complex diseases. Runtime logs ensure full reproducibility and the modularized ATAV framework makes it extensible to continuous development. Besides helping with the identification of disease-causing variants for a range of diseases, ATAV has also enabled the discovery of disease-genes by rare-variant collapsing on datasets containing more than 20,000 samples. Analyses to date have been performed on data of more than 110,000 individuals demonstrating the scalability of the framework.
              
                To allow users to easily access variant-level data directly from the database, we provide a web-based interface, the ATAV data browser (
                http://atavdb.org/
                ). Through this browser, summary-level data for more than 40,000 samples can be queried by the general public representing a mix of cases and controls of diverse ancestries. Users have access to phenotype categories of variant carriers, as well as predicted ancestry, gender, and quality metrics. In contrast to many other platforms, the data browser is able to show data of newly-added samples in real-time and therefore evolves rapidly as more and more samples are sequenced.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Through ATAV, users have public access to one of the largest variant databases for patients sequenced at a tertiary care center and can look up any genes or variants of interest. Additionally, since the entire code is freely available on GitHub, ATAV can easily be deployed by other groups that wish to build their own platform, database, and user interface.},

            Patch clamp recording of neurons is a labor-intensive and time-consuming procedure. Here, we demonstrate a tool that fully automatically performs electrophysiological recordings in label-free tissue slices. The automation covers the detection of cells in label-free images, calibration of the micropipette movement, approach to the cell with the pipette, formation of the whole-cell configuration, and recording. The cell detection is based on deep learning. The model is trained on a new image database of neurons in unlabeled brain tissue slices. The pipette tip detection and approaching phase use image analysis techniques for precise movements. High-quality measurements are performed on hundreds of human and rodent neurons. We also demonstrate that further molecular and anatomical analysis can be performed on the recorded cells. The software has a diary module that automatically logs patch clamp events. Our tool can multiply the number of daily measurements to help brain research.},

	abstract = {In many software systems logging has been implemented inaccurately, their effectiveness during the maintenance period to identify the failures and address them quickly is very less. This in turn increases the software maintenance cost and reduces reliability of the system as many errors are unreported. This paper aims at proposing and studying a rule based approach to make the logs more effective. The source code of the target systems gets reverse engineered and acts as the primary input for this approach to introduce the automated logs into the source code. This is instrumented by a logger code driven by a set of predefined rules which are woven around the life cycle of the system entities. The validity of the approach is verified by means of a preliminary fault injection experiment into a real world system.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis is often more complex and toxic with longer treatment time and poor treatment outcomes including treatment failure or death. Monitoring drug-resistant tuberculosis therapy including early identification of prognostic factors and close monitoring of body weight in resource-limited settings is crucial to ensure successful treatment. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess time to poor treatment outcome which is defined as the proportion of all patients who died or failed treatment and its predictors among drug-resistant tuberculosis patients on second-line anti-tuberculosis treatment in Amhara region, Ethiopia.
            
            
              Methods
              
                A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all patients who started drug-resistant tuberculosis therapy from September 1, 2010 through December 31, 2017, at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Boru-Meda Hospital, and Debre-Markos Referral Hospital in Amhara Region, Ethiopia. Data were entered using Epi-data Version 3.1 and analyzed using R version 3.41 software. The survival time was estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival curve and the survival time between different categorical variables were compared using the log rank test. Event time ratio with 95\% confidence interval (CI) and
                p
                -value less than 0.05 were used to measure the strength of association and to declare statistically significant predictors respectively.
              
            
            
              Results
              A total of 508 patients with a median age of 28.5 [IQR: 22–40] years were included in this study. The overall cumulative survival probability of patients at the end of 24 months was 79\% [95\% CI,75,84\%]. Rate of body weight change [Adjusted time ratio (ATR) = 5; 95\% CI: 3.2, 7.7], secondary and above level of education [ATR = 2.3;95\% CI:1.2,2.9], being non-anemic [ATR = 2.8,95\% CI:1.2,3.8], being non-diabetic [ATR = 3.4;95\% CI:1.3,8.8], without clinical complications [ATR = 7.6;95\% CI:4.2,13.9], HIV negative [ATR = 1. 94:95\% CI:1.35,2.35] and residing in rural [ATR = 0.51,95\% CI:0.30,0.86] were predictors of time to poor treatment outcomes.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The survival rate of tuberculosis patients was higher at end of follow up relative to other studies. However, poor treatment outcome was higher in early phase of therapy. Educational level, rural residence, HIV/AIDS, diabetes mellitus, previous treatment, clinical complication, rate of body weight change and smoking history were significant predictors of time to poor treatment outcome. Therefore, intervention programs should focus on the identified factors to improve survival time of drug-resistant tuberculosis patients.},

Approach to storage software diagnostics, presented in current paper, combines a log mining algorithms for fault detection based on natural language processing text classification methods, and usage of the diagnostic model for a task of fault source detection. Currently existing approaches to computational systems diagnostics are either ignoring system or event log data, using only numeric monitoring parameters, or target only certain log types or use logs to create chains of the structured events. The main advantage of using natural language processing method for log text classification is that no information of log message structure or log message source, or log purpose is required if there is enough data for classificator model training. Developed diagnostic procedure has accuracy score comparable with existing methods and can target all presented in training set faults without prior log structure research.},

	abstract = {In modern Machine Learning, model training is an iterative, experimental process that can consume enormous computation resources and developer time. To aid in that process, experienced model developers log and visualize program variables during training runs. Exhaustive logging of all variables is infeasible, so developers are left to choose between slowing down training via extensive
              conservative
              logging, or letting training run fast via minimalist
              optimistic
              logging that may omit key information. As a compromise, optimistic logging can be accompanied by program checkpoints; this allows developers to add log statements post-hoc, and "replay" desired log statements from checkpoint---a process we refer to as
              hindsight
              logging. Unfortunately, hindsight logging raises tricky problems in data management and software engineering. Done poorly, hindsight logging can waste resources and generate technical debt embodied in multiple variants of training code. In this paper, we present methodologies for efficient and effective logging practices for model training, with a focus on techniques for hindsight logging. Our goal is for experienced model developers to learn and adopt these practices. To make this easier, we provide an open-source suite of tools for Fast Low-Overhead Recovery (flor) that embodies our design across three tasks: (i) efficient background logging in Python, (ii) adaptive periodic checkpointing, and (iii) an instrumentation library that codifies hindsight logging for efficient and automatic record-replay of model-training. Model developers can use each flor tool separately as they see fit, or they can use flor in hands-free mode, entrusting it to instrument their code end-to-end for efficient record-replay. Our solutions leverage techniques from physiological transaction logs and recovery in database systems. Evaluations on modern ML benchmarks demonstrate that flor can produce fast checkpointing with small user-specifiable overheads (e.g. 7\%), and still provide hindsight log replay times orders of magnitude faster than restarting training from scratch.},

	abstract = {Flash memory is widely used in solid state drives (SSD), smartphones and so on because of their non-volatility, low power consumption, rapid access speed, and resistance to shocks. Due to the hardware features of flash memory that differ from hard disk drives (HDD), a software called FTL (Flash Translation Layer) was presented. The function of FTL is to make flash memory device appear as a block device to its host. However, due to the erase before write features of flash memory, flash blocks need to be constantly availed through the garbage collection (GC) of invalid pages, which incurs high-priced overhead. In the previous hybrid mapping schemes, there are three problems that cause GC overhead. First, operation of partial merge causes more page copies than operation of switch merge. However, many authors just concentrate on reducing operation of full merge. Second, the availability between a data block and a log block makes the space availability of the log block lower, and it also generates a very high-priced operation of full merge. Third, the space availability of the data block is low because the data block, which has many free pages, is merged. Therefore, we propose a new FTL named DSFTL (Dynamic Setting for FTL). In this FTL, we use many SW (sequential write) log blocks to increase operation of switch merge and to decrease operation of partial merge. In addition, DSFTL dynamically handles the data blocks and log blocks to reduce the operations of erase and the high-priced operation of full merge. Additionally, our scheme prevents the data block with many free pages from being merged to increase the space availability of the data block. Our extensive experimental results prove that our proposed approach (DSFTL) reduces the count of erase and increases the operation of switch merge. As a result, DSFTL decreases the garbage collection overhead.},

	abstract = {Objectives
              The COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore has largely centred around migrant worker dormitories, comprising over 90\% of all cases in the country. Dormitories are home to a culturally and linguistically distinct, low-income population, without on-site healthcare after-hours. The primary objective of this study was to assess the engagement and utilisation of a simple, low-cost, accessible, mobile health solution for remote self-reporting of vital parameters in dormitory residents with COVID-19.
            
            
              Design
              Retrospective review of medical care.
            
            
              Setting
              Two large migrant worker dormitories with a combined population of 31 546.
            
            
              Participants
              All COVID-19-affected residents housed in dormitories during the study period.
            
            
              Intervention
              All residents were taught to use a chat assistant to self-report their temperature, heart rate and oxygen saturations. Results flowed into a dashboard, which alerted clinicians of abnormal results.
            
            
              Outcomes
              The primary outcome measure was engagement rate. This was derived from the total number of residents who registered on the platform over the total number of COVID-19-affected residents in the dormitories during the study period. Secondary outcome measures included outcomes of the alerts and subsequent escalations of care.
            
            
              Results
              800 of the 931 COVID-19-affected residents (85.9\%) engaged with the platform to log a total of 12 511 discrete episodes of vital signs. Among 372 abnormal readings, 96 teleconsultations were initiated, of which 7 (1.8\%) were escalated to emergency services and 18 (4.9\%) were triaged to earlier physical medical review on-site.
            
            
              Conclusions
              A chat-assistant-based self-reporting platform is an effective and safe community-based intervention to monitor marginalised populations with distinct cultural and linguistic backgrounds, living communally and affected by COVID-19. Lessons learnt from this approach may be applied to develop safe and cost-effective telemedicine solutions across similar settings.},

DDoS attacks of a victim network. In addition, separating network monitoring from its control aims
at mitigating DDoS attacks of a victim network. Traffic pattern analysis is apart from attack detection
mechanism that gives a conceptual representation of a specific kind of DDoS attacks. DDoS detection
is a completely automated process. Once called, for the reaction, the active response will be taken

              The communication time overhead was tested in order to evaluate the remote server response time in
case of deploying our proposed model mechanisms and without our proposed model.
            
            
              :
              Here we introduce a response mechanism that consists of an analysis of event logs, traffic patterns,
and IP traceback. The proposed model categorizes the underlying network according to the location
into a victim network and the source of attack (public cloud).
            
            
              Results \& Conclusion::
              The proposed model implemented in a hybrid cloud environment using the
network of SDN and legacy network. The experimental setup was built using our network lab connected
to the Amazon public cloud.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Advances in high-throughput methods have brought new challenges for biological data analysis, often requiring many interdependent steps applied to a large number of samples. To address this challenge, workflow management systems, such as Watchdog, have been developed to support scientists in the (semi-)automated execution of large analysis workflows.
            
            
              Implementation
              Here, we present Watchdog 2.0, which implements new developments for module creation, reusability, and documentation and for reproducibility of analyses and workflow execution. Developments include a graphical user interface for semi-automatic module creation from software help pages, sharing repositories for modules and workflows, and a standardized module documentation format. The latter allows generation of a customized reference book of public and user-specific modules. Furthermore, extensive logging of workflow execution, module and software versions, and explicit support for package managers and container virtualization now ensures reproducibility of results. A step-by-step analysis protocol generated from the log file may, e.g., serve as a draft of a manuscript methods section. Finally, 2 new execution modes were implemented. One allows resuming workflow execution after interruption or modification without rerunning successfully executed tasks not affected by changes. The second one allows detaching and reattaching to workflow execution on a local computer while tasks continue running on computer clusters.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Watchdog 2.0 provides several new developments that we believe to be of benefit for large-scale bioinformatics analysis and that are not completely covered by other competing workflow management systems. The software itself, module and workflow repositories, and comprehensive documentation are freely available at https://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/watchdog.},

	abstract = {There is a growing body of literature on process mining in healthcare. Process mining of electronic health record systems could give benefit into better understanding of the actual processes happened in the patient treatment, from the event log of the hospital information system. Researchers report issues of data access approval, anonymisation constraints, and data quality. One solution to progress methodology development is to use a high-quality, freely available research dataset such as Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III, a critical care database which contains the records of 46,520 intensive care unit patients over 12 years. Our article aims to (1) explore data quality issues for healthcare process mining using Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III, (2) provide a structured assessment of Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III data quality and challenge for process mining, and (3) provide a worked example of cancer treatment as a case study of process mining using Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III to illustrate an approach and solution to data quality challenges. The electronic health record software was upgraded partway through the period over which data was collected and we use this event to explore the link between electronic health record system design and resulting process models.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            A standard approach to analysis of case-cohort data involves fitting log-linear models. In this paper, we describe how standard statistical software can be used to fit a broad class of general relative rate models to case-cohort data and derive confidence intervals. We focus on a case-cohort design in which a roster has been assembled and events ascertained but additional information needs to be collected on explanatory variables. The additional information is ascertained just for persons who experience the event of interest and for a sample of the cohort members enumerated at study entry. One appeal of such a case-cohort design is that this sample of the cohort may be used to support analyses of several outcomes. The ability to fit general relative rate models to case-cohort data may allow an investigator to reduce model misspecification in exposure-response analyses, fit models in which some factors have effects that are additive and others multiplicative, and facilitate estimation of relative excess risk due to interaction. We address model fitting for simple random sampling study designs as well as stratified designs. Data on lung cancer among radon-exposed men (Colorado Plateau uranium miners, 1950–1990) are used to illustrate these methods.},

Developers must possess intimate knowledge of low-level interfaces to manually handle the subtleties of data consistency and misaligned accesses.
            
            
              We present
              SPIN

              We evaluate SPIN on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs using standard file I/O benchmarks, application traces, and end-to-end experiments. SPIN achieves significant performance speedups across a wide range of workloads, exceeding

It also boosts the performance of an aerial imagery rendering application by 2.6× by dynamically adapting to its input-dependent file access pattern, enables 3.3× higher throughput for a GPU-accelerated log server, and enables 29\% faster execution for the highly optimized GPU-accelerated image collage with only 30 changed lines of code.},

            Facies prediction is an important step in reservoir characterization and modeling. Define a representative reservoir model will enhance the process of reservoir development and will optimize the economic strategies. The lack of data is a key issue in reservoir characterizations and therefore alternative approaches have to be adopted to improve the process of reservoir characterization. In this research, clustering analysis was implemented as a statistical solution to classify reservoir facies given well logs and core data in a reservoir from the south of Iraq.
            In this research, data from a heterogeneous carbonate reservoir were used. The data included well log records such; GR, SP, Density, Neutron Porosity, Total Porosity, Resistivity, Induction, Shale Volume, Water Saturation, along with porosity and permeability values from core analysis. These data were integrated and analyzed through statistical tools to perform clustering analysis. The clustering analysis is an approach of finding the similarities and differences between specific groups or points in order to classify them into different classes. This concept was implemented by the use of R software, which is a quite powerful open source tool for statistical studies with variety of functions and packages. Two different clustering algorithms, K-mean approach and Calinski-Harabasz solution were used to classify reservoir facies based on the given data.
            The results of this research show that the reservoir facies can be predicted through different clustering analysis when well logs records are given. K-means approach has predicted the optimal facies classification to be five, while Calinski-Harabasz technique has identified three optimal reservoir facies. The difference in facies classification between the two clustering analysis approaches is attributed to the two approaches sensitivity because of the high quality rocks in all the units of this well, which makes it challenging to identify the facies as all the layers have similer reservoir properties.},

	abstract = {The Geodetic Observatory Wettzell (GOW), jointly operated by the Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (BKG), Germany and the Technical University of Munich, Germany is equipped with three radio telescopes for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). Correlation capability is primarily designed for relative positioning of the three Wettzell radio telescopes i.e., to derive the local ties between the three telescopes from VLBI raw data in addition to the conventional terrestrial surveys. A computing cluster forming the GO Wettzell Local Correlator (GOWL) was installed in 2017 as well as the Distributed FX (DiFX) software correlation package and the Haystack Observatory Postprocessing System (HOPS) for fringe fitting and postprocessing of the output. Data pre-processing includes ambiguity resolution (if necessary) as well as the generation of the geodetic database and NGS card files with    υ   Solve. The final analysis is either carried out with local processing software (LEVIKA short baseline analysis) or with the Vienna VLBI and Satellite (VieVS) software. We will present an overview of the scheduling, correlation and analysis capabilities at GOW and results obtained so. The dataset includes auxiliary files (schedule and log files) which contain information about the participating antenna, observed sources, clock offset between formatter and GPS time, cable delay, meteorological parameters (temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity) and ASCII files created after fringe fitting and final analysis. The published dataset can be used by the researchers and scientists to further explore short baseline interferometry.},

	abstract = {Cure fraction models are useful to model lifetime data with long-term survivors. We propose a flexible four-parameter cure rate survival model called the log-sinh Cauchy promotion time model for predicting breast carcinoma survival in women who underwent mastectomy. The model can estimate simultaneously the effects of the explanatory variables on the timing acceleration/deceleration of a given event, the surviving fraction, the heterogeneity, and the possible existence of bimodality in the data. In order to examine the performance of the proposed model, simulations are presented to verify the robust aspects of this flexible class against outlying and influential observations. Furthermore, we determine some diagnostic measures and the one-step approximations of the estimates in the case-deletion model. The new model was implemented in the generalized additive model for location, scale and shape package of the R software, which is presented throughout the paper by way of a brief tutorial on its use. The potential of the new regression model to accurately predict breast carcinoma mortality is illustrated using a real data set.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Robust assessment is a crucial component in Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) training to determine whether participants have achieved learning objectives with little or no variation in their overall outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate resuscitation performance by real-time logs. We hypothesised that instructors may not be able to evaluate time-sensitive parameters, namely, chest compression fraction, time to initiating chest compression and time to initiating defibrillation accurately in a subjective manner.
            
            
              Methods
              Video records and formal checklist-based test results of Megacode scenarios for the ACLS certification examination at several hospitals in Taipei were examined. For the study interest, three time-sensitive parameters were measured via video review assisted by a mobile phone application, and were used for evaluation. We evaluated if the pass/fail results made by instructors via checklists were correlated with these parameters.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 185 Megacode scenarios were eligible for the final analysis. Among the three parameters, good chest compression fraction was statistically significant with a higher OR of passing (OR=3.65; 95\% CI 1.36 to 9.91; p=0.01). In 112 participants with one parameter that did not meet the criteria, 25 were graded as fail, making the specificity 22.3\% (95\% CI 15.0\% to 31.2\%).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Visual observation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation performance is not accurate when evaluating time-sensitive parameters. Objective results should be offered for training outcome evaluation, and also for feedback to participants.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to identify the role of emotional aspects in information retrieval of PhD students from the web.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              From the methodological perspective, the present study is experimental and the type of study is practical. The study population is PhD students of various fields of science. The study sample consists of 50 students as selected by the stratified purposive sampling method. The information aggregation is performed by observing the records of user’s facial expressions, log file by Morae software, as well as pre-search and post-search questionnaire. The data analysis is performed by canonical correlation analysis.
            
            
              Findings
              The findings showed that there was a significant relationship between emotional expressions and searchers’ individual characteristics. Searchers satisfaction of results, frequency internet search, experience of search, interest in the search task and familiarity with similar searches were correlated with the increased happy emotion. The examination of user’s emotions during searching performance showed that users with happiness emotion dedicated much time in searching and viewing of search solutions. More internet addresses with more queries were used by happy participants; on the other hand, users with anger and disgust emotions had the lowest attempt in search performance to complete search process.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The results imply that the information retrieval systems in the web should identify emotional expressions in a set of perceiving signs in human interaction with computer, similarity, face emotional states, searching and information retrieval from the web.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The results explicit in the automatic identification of users’ emotional expressions can enter new dimensions into their moderator and information retrieval systems on the web and can pave the way of design of emotional information retrieval systems for the successful retrieval of users of the network.},

Using VisCareTrails, a data visualization software system based on the principle of timed word trees, we were able to identify five novel behaviors that informed our understanding of how players were approaching the game. We further utilized these newly identified player behaviors by triangulating them with geometry test scores collected from players outside the game setting. We compared the predictive capacity of these behaviors against five demographic characteristics commonly observed to be associated with educational outcomes: age, gender, ethnicity, mother’s education, and attitude toward video games. Two of the novel behaviors we identified, both reflecting inflexible problem-solving strategies, outperformed all demographic variables except age in terms of predicting change in geometry test scores post-gameplay. We believe that this is sound evidence for the utility of VisCareTrails and the timed-word-tree method for identifying pedagogically relevant player behaviors from semi-structured data associated with educational games.},

	abstract = {Background:
              Recently, some authors have defined new molecular descriptors (MDs) based on the
use of the Graph Discrete Derivative, known as Graph Derivative Indices (GDI). This new approach about discrete
derivatives over various elements from a graph takes as outset the formation of subgraphs. Previously,
these definitions were extended into the chemical context (N-tuples) and interpreted in structural/physicalchemical
terms as well as applied into the description of several endpoints, with good results.
            
            
              Objective:
              A generalization of GDIs using the definitions of Higher Order and Mixed Derivative for molecular
graphs is proposed as a generalization of the previous works, allowing the generation of a new family of MDs.
            
            
              Methods:
              An extension of the previously defined GDIs is presented, and for this purpose, the concept of Higher
Order Derivatives and Mixed Derivatives is introduced. These novel approaches to obtaining MDs based on the
concepts of discrete derivatives (finite difference) of the molecular graphs use the elements of the hypermatrices
conceived from 12 different ways (12 events) of fragmenting the molecular structures. The result of applying
the higher order and mixed GDIs over any molecular structure allows finding Local Vertex Invariants (LOVIs)
for atom-pairs, for atoms-pairs-pairs and so on. All new families of GDIs are implemented in a computational
software denominated DIVATI (acronym for Discrete DeriVAtive Type Indices), a module of KeysFinder
Framework in TOMOCOMD-CARDD system.
            
            
              Results:
              QSAR modeling of the biological activity (Log 1/K) of 31 steroids reveals that the GDIs obtained using
the higher order and mixed GDIs approaches yield slightly higher performance compared to previously reported
approaches based on the duplex, triplex and quadruplex matrix. In fact, the statistical parameters for
models obtained with the higher-order and mixed GDI method are superior to those reported in the literature by
using other 0-3D QSAR methods.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              It can be suggested that the higher-order and mixed GDIs, appear as a promissory tool in
QSAR/QSPRs, similarity/dissimilarity analysis and virtual screening studies.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Production and well intervention history for the Rokan Light Oil, Sumatra, Indonesia operations region spans 90 years across 115 fields and more than 5000 wells. This vast production history results in large and diverse datasets that are difficult to manage. A simple and cost-effective data analytics solution, the "Well History Browser", was developed using the Data Analytic Application platform to address issues of big data management and analysis.
            Prior to development of the Well History Browser, Petroleum Engineer and Earth Scientist workflows relied on the need to work through multiple software platforms, such as web access portals, well log applications, homeless local drive files, and purpose-built Excel spreadsheets. Complicating matters was the fact that most legacy tools were developed for specific field assets and were not transferable to other assets within the organization. Furthermore, many of the tools were dependent on specific developers for maintenance and modification, which made it difficult to keep the tools working after staffing and organizational changes.
            The Well History Browser was developed to address these issues by providing a compact and efficient access point to all information within a single platform analysis. Data streams available within the analysis include a complete history of well metadata and status, allocated production and injection, well tests, well interventions, well opportunities, swab tests, spinner surveys, pressure surveys, perforations, and wellbore equipment. Example workflows that use the Well History Browser include offset / analog well production analysis for infill drilling, workover opportunity assessment and planning, daily field and well performance monitoring, subsurface integrity monitoring, decline type curve analysis, and production forecasting. Key enablers for development of the tool include construction of custom database tables and views, the use of data-on-demand database connections, IronPython scripts (streamlines the analysis by enabling development of shortcuts and automation), and TERR scripts (extends the computational power to allow for development of custom analyses).
            Shortly following release two years ago, the user-friendly tool was rapidly adopted by petrotech staff across the organization. The current daily user base is greater than 70 staff. Since initial release, tool developers have responded to user feedback by implementing visualization changes, adding analytic functions and creating automated workflows, all of which have been facilitated by the richly featured, low-code development platform. The Well History Browser has had a profound impact on staff efficiency in reducing cycle time spent in accessing well data and in increasing effectiveness in production data analysis. The result has been an increase in the quantity and the quality of well intervention and infill well opportunity identification.},

	abstract = {Performance analysis and continuous process improvement efforts are often supported by the construction of process models representing the interactions of the partners in the supply chain. This study was conducted to determine the state of the art in the process mining field, specifically in the context of cross-organizational process. The Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method is used to review a collection of twenty-one papers that are classified according to the Artifact framework of Hevner, et al. and within the Process Mining framework of Van der Aalst. In the reviewed papers, the authors conducted a variety of techniques to establish the event log, which is then used to perform the process mining analysis. Eight of the reviewed papers focus on the definition of concepts or measures. Five of the papers describe models and other abstractions that are used as a theoretical basis for process mining in the context of supply chains. The majority twenty of papers describe some kind of informal method or formal algorithm to perform process mining analysis. Nine of the papers that propose a formal algorithm also present an accompanying software implementation. Eight papers discuss the data preparation challenges and twelve papers discuss process discovery techniques.},

	abstract = {Monitoring and troubleshooting distributed systems is notoriously difficult; potential problems are complex, varied, and unpredictable. The monitoring and diagnosis tools commonly used today—logs, counters, and metrics—have two important limitations: what gets recorded is defined
              a priori
              , and the information is recorded in a component- or machine-centric way, making it extremely hard to correlate events that cross these boundaries. This article presents Pivot Tracing, a monitoring framework for distributed systems that addresses both limitations by combining dynamic instrumentation with a novel relational operator: the happened-before join. Pivot Tracing gives users, at runtime, the ability to define arbitrary metrics at one point of the system, while being able to select, filter, and group by events meaningful at other parts of the system, even when crossing component or machine boundaries. We have implemented a prototype of Pivot Tracing for Java-based systems and evaluate it on a heterogeneous Hadoop cluster comprising HDFS, HBase, MapReduce, and YARN. We show that Pivot Tracing can effectively identify a diverse range of root causes such as software bugs, misconfiguration, and limping hardware. We show that Pivot Tracing is dynamic, extensible, and enables cross-tier analysis between inter-operating applications, with low execution overhead.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Complex software systems are continuously generating application and server logs for the events which had occurred in the past. These logs generated and can be utilized for anomaly and intrusion detection. These log files can be used for anomaly or outlier detection. Certain types of abnormalities or exceptions such as spikes in HTTP requests, number of exceptions raised in logs, etc. All these events are logged into the log files for further analysis. These types of events are generally used for predicting the anomalies in future. The developed prototype assumes that the user inputs log records in a standard apache log format. At first the user uploads the log file for outlier detection. Next, a prototype is developed to get the number of HTTP requests for outlier detection. Then anomalies in number of HTTP requests are detected using three techniques namely InterQuartileRange method, Moving averages and Median Absolute deviation. Once the outliers are detected, these outliers are removed from the current dataset. This output is given as input to the Multilayer Perceptron model to predict the number of HTTP requests at the next timestamp{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater} {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Current guidelines recommend open gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection and adjuvant chemotherapy as the standard treatment for advanced gastric cancer. However, the prognosis is not satisfactory. Perioperative chemotherapy has been proposed to improve survival. Although still in debate, the efficacy of laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) in patients with advanced gastric cancer has been demonstrated in a few trials. Therefore, LDG after neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be a candidate for future standard treatment on advanced distal gastric cancer. We propose a randomised phase II trial to compare LDG and open distal gastrectomy (ODG) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer.
            
            
              Methods and analysis
              To test the efficacy and safety, a randomised, open-label, single-centre, phase II trial was designed to evaluate the non-inferiority of LDG compared with ODG after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with 3-year recurrence-free survival as the primary endpoint. The chosen critical value of a non-inferiority margin was an increase of {\textless}8\%. The study started in 2015 and enrolled 96 patients according to a prior sample size calculation. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol approach will be used for efficacy analysis, and as-treated analysis will be applied for safety analysis. The survival curves will be constructed as time-to-event plots using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards model. All statistical analyses will be conducted in standard statistical software with a significance level of 0.05.

In this case, programs are developed by the software developers in such a way that whenever an event happens it can be recorded. Among its many uses, system troubleshooting is of greatest importance. Manual methods of logging can be adopted when dealing with a smaller process but mostly log sizes can go from kilobytes to terabytes in size for which log analyzing tools are required. In addition to that, those tools should be capable of extracting all the relevant information so that it becomes easy to highlight the ongoing issues in an effective manner.

	abstract = {In this work, we develop the
              Orchestrated File System (OrcFS)
              for Flash storage. OrcFS vertically integrates the log-structured file system and the Flash-based storage device to eliminate the redundancies across the layers. A few modern file systems adopt sophisticated append-only data structures in an effort to optimize the behavior of the file system with respect to the append-only nature of the Flash memory. While the benefit of adopting an append-only data structure seems fairly promising, it makes the stack of software layers full of unnecessary redundancies, leaving substantial room for improvement. The redundancies include (i) redundant levels of indirection (address translation), (ii) duplicate efforts to reclaim the invalid blocks (i.e., segment cleaning in the file system and garbage collection in the storage device), and (iii) excessive over-provisioning (i.e., separate over-provisioning areas in each layer). OrcFS eliminates these redundancies via distributing the address translation, segment cleaning (or garbage collection), bad block management, and wear-leveling across the layers. Existing solutions suffer from high segment cleaning overhead and cause significant write amplification due to mismatch between the file system block size and the Flash page size. To optimize the I/O stack while avoiding these problems, OrcFS adopts three key technical elements.
            
            
              First, OrcFS uses
              disaggregate mapping
              , whereby it partitions the Flash storage into two areas, managed by a file system and Flash storage, respectively, with different granularity. In OrcFS, the metadata area and data area are maintained by 4Kbyte page granularity and 256Mbyte superblock granularity. The
              superblock-based storage management
              aligns the file system section size, which is a unit of segment cleaning, with the superblock size of the underlying Flash storage. It can fully exploit the internal parallelism of the underlying Flash storage, exploiting the sequential workload characteristics of the log-structured file system. Second, OrcFS adopts
              quasi-preemptive segment cleaning
              to prohibit the foreground I/O operation from being interfered with by segment cleaning. The latency to reclaim the free space can be prohibitive in OrcFS due to its large file system section size, 256Mbyte. OrcFS effectively addresses this issue via adopting a polling-based segment cleaning scheme. Third, the OrcFS introduces
              block patching
              to avoid unnecessary write amplification in the partial page program. OrcFS is the enhancement of the F2FS file system. We develop a prototype OrcFS based on F2FS and server class SSD with modified firmware (Samsung 843TN). OrcFS reduces the device mapping table requirement to 1/465 and 1/4 compared with the page mapping and the smallest mapping scheme known to the public, respectively. Via eliminating the redundancy in the segment cleaning and garbage collection, the OrcFS reduces 1/3 of the write volume under heavy random write workload. OrcFS achieves 56\% performance gain against EXT4 in
              varmail
              workload.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              Process mining provides a generic collection of techniques to turn event data into valuable insights, improvement ideas, predictions, and recommendations. This paper uses spreadsheets as a metaphor to introduce process mining as an essential tool for data scientists and business analysts. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate that process mining can do with events what spreadsheets can do with numbers.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The paper discusses the main concepts in both spreadsheets and process mining. Using a concrete data set as a running example, the different types of process mining are explained. Where spreadsheets work with numbers, process mining starts from event data with the aim to analyze processes.
            
            
              Findings
              Differences and commonalities between spreadsheets and process mining are described. Unlike process mining tools like ProM, spreadsheets programs cannot be used to discover processes, check compliance, analyze bottlenecks, animate event data, and provide operational process support. Pointers to existing process mining tools and their functionality are given.
            
            
              Practical implications
              Event logs and operational processes can be found everywhere and process mining techniques are not limited to specific application domains. Comparable to spreadsheet software widely used in finance, production, sales, education, and sports, process mining software can be used in a broad range of organizations.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The paper provides an original view on process mining by relating it to the spreadsheets. The value of spreadsheet-like technology tailored toward the analysis of behavior rather than numbers is illustrated by the over 20 commercial process mining tools available today and the growing adoption in a variety of application domains.},

	abstract = {Genetic factors that influence inflammation and energy production/expenditure in cells may affect patient outcomes following treatment with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Sestrins, stress-inducible genes with antioxidant properties, have recently been implicated in several behaviors including fatigue. This proof-of-concept study explored whether the sestrin family of genes ( SESN1, SESN2, and SESN3) were differentially expressed from baseline to the midpoint of EBRT in a sample of 26 Puerto Rican men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. We also examined whether changes in expression of these genes were associated with changes in fatigue scores during EBRT.
            
              Method:
              Participants completed the 13-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy—Fatigue subscale, Spanish version. Whole blood samples were collected at baseline and at the midpoint of EBRT. Gene expression data were analyzed using the limma package in the R (version R 2.14.0.) statistical software. Linear models and empirical Bayes moderation, adjusted for radiation fraction (total number of days of prescribed radiation treatment), were used to examine potential associations between changes in gene expression and change in fatigue scores.
            
            
              Results:
              Expression of SESN3 (adjusted p {\textless} .01, log fold change −0.649) was significantly downregulated during EBRT, whereas the expressions of SESN1 and SESN2 remained unchanged. After adjustment for radiation fraction, change in SESN3 expression was associated with change in fatigue during EBRT (false discovery rate {\textless}.01).
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Downregulation of SESN3, a novel pharmacoactive stress response gene, was associated with fatigue intensification during EBRT. SESN3 may serve as an interventional target and a biomarker for the cellular and molecular events associated with EBRT-related fatigue.},

            The design of an optimal and effective hydraulic fracture treatment requires lots of input data, spanning the spectrum from rock properties, fluid properties, well-logs, Geomechanics to economics. However, operators tend to cut costs by reducing expenditure on data acquisition. This paper discusses the challenges of hydraulic fracture treatment design in such cases and presents procedures that can be used to effectively design fracture treatments where completion engineers may not find the needed data from obvious direct sources. Recommended solutions for obtaining data from indirect sources to fill the gap of unavailable data are presented. In addition, the adequacy of such designs is evaluated and compared to actual hydraulic fracturing treatments pumped.
            Treatment designs pumped for several stages of a fractured well located in the Permian Basin of West Texas, US were investigated. This is a geologically complex environment with huge variation in lithology and formation properties. The well under study had only the drilling records and the conventional logs suite (gamma ray, neutron, density, pe and resistivity). However, to finalize other required data for the treatment design i.e. reservoir permeability, geomechanical properties, etc., the design inputs were obtained through the creation of synthetic logs. Sonic logs were generated using models created from log data from off-set wells. In addition, geological properties of the candidate formation were reviewed and used for data calibration. These collected data were then used in designing the hydraulic fracture treatment using industry standard fracture design software, FRACPRO, to obtain the design outcomes. The treatment was designed and simulated using the same fluid systems and proppants as was used in the actual pumped treatments. Finally, the design results were compared to the field treatment data from the fractured well.
            Compared to real-time fracturing results, the pressure and rate profiles were close match to those generated by the software. This shows the possibility of conducting a proper fracturing design using limited acquired data. However, these results depend mainly on the accuracy of the well logs used to generate the mechanical properties, and the available data about the formation from previous treatments. Moreover, the accuracy of fracturing simulation when all needed data are obtained by direct measurements should be compared to situations with paucity of data, to determine how to improve the results obtained.
            The information presented in this work will help engineers deliver economic and optimal hydraulic fracture treatments especially in this present low oil price regime. Also, informed and appropriate decisions can be made regarding optimized data acquisition in candidate formations for better planning and maximum profitability.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This paper is devoted to integrated use of well tests and well logging in horizontal MSF wells to assess the current condition and predict productivity of the wells in abnormally tight reservoirs.
            To meet the this objective, we used a digital model of a horizontal MSF well that includes irregular distribution of fractures along the wellbore, differences in fracture geometries and conductivities, reservoir heterogeneities in terms of flow properties. To make calculations an Eclipse model was run with a refined space-time grid taking into consideration the task geometry.
            The resulting wellbore pressure-time curves and production-rate curves for individual wells were considered as welltest inputs. All of them were interpreted using GDIS (Sapphire) software to estimate the full range of parameters that this suite allows to determine.
            Then, the obtained results were reviewed in order to:
            – assess the inversion efficiency subject to relation between the fracture system geometry and reservoir flow properties; – estimate individual fracture parameters and reservoir heterogeneity characteristics using a priori PLT data on the contribution of each fracture to the total well flow rate.
            Welltest time may be insufficient to diagnose all the flow regimes inherent to the horizontal MSF wells. The most appropriate solution would be, therefore, to use welltest results at early times of linear and radial flow regimes.
            This analysis has the advantage that at early times the fractures do not interfere between themselves. These conditions are the most convenient to determine individual parameters of each fracture. However, a priori data on the reservoir heterogeneity (openhole logging data) is needed to solve this problem, and PLT data is needed to evaluate the rate of variation of each fracture contribution to the total production (injection) volume.
            The statement of this problem is the most favorable when a homogeneous reservoir is penetrated. In that case:
            – welltest data within the linear flow interval allows estimating parameter which is proportional to the total surface area of all the fractures, while PLT data allows estimating the ratio between the fracture lengths. – welltest data within the pseudoradial flow interval allows estimating the reservoir flow parameters.
            When the well produces from a significantly heterogeneous reservoir, one needs to know the permeability distribution along the wellbore to solve similar problems. These may be the results of estimating not the absolute values of that parameter (this problem cannot be always successfully solved from PLT data) but its relative variations.
            To rapidly assess the above parameters, authors suggest approximate relationships validated by modeling results.
            The obtained computational relationships differ from their analogs and were used by the authors to validate and predict horizontal MSF well productivity from the integrated welltest and well logging surveys. Modeling results allow validating the optimal technology to test and log the wells and interpret the obtained results to solve this problem.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Access to real time production and injection data available on a desktop greatly enhances a production optimization engineer's efficiency. This paper describes a smart management system utilized for retrieving and evaluating all flow assurance related data for more than 700 wells. These wells are located in both onshore \& offshore fields operated by Cairn Oil \& Gas, a vertical of Vedanta Limited. The paper discusses system architecture, interface details, system design, functionality, visualization, application and benefits of the system.
            To avoid unnecessary replication of data entry or retrieval, the system interfaces with other software systems. The software is also capable of direct hardware interfacing for data retrieval and system control. Currently the system connects to a range of software that includes Digital Oilfield Management System, Well Intervention Information System, and Laboratory Information Management System. The smart system is utilized as a single point for managing/ monitoring data from all such interfaces. Data may also be entered manually using standard templates, csv files, attachments (videos, photographs, documents, log files etc.) and spreadsheets.
            The system is fully web-enabled, real time and is used for performance monitoring of all flow assurance and well stimulation related data. The data includes stimulation treatment design, scale inhibitor squeeze performance, scale monitoring and prediction, water chemistry, chemical performance monitoring, corrosion prediction and monitoring etc. The input data is converted into information within the system by a powerful calculation/logic engine; enabling users to analyze issues/problems more efficiently and provide faster resolution. The system includes automatic alarms, emails, reporting, future projections, etc.
            Automated cumulative cost performance plots (Scorpion plots) are also inbuilt in the system and are used to evaluate cost-benefit of individual chemical treatments. These analyses enable well productivity to be improved and ineffectual operations to be abandoned. Examples of well stimulation assessment are included, which illustrate the value of analytics on performance improvement. The smart system covers raw data to dashboard information and setting realistic KPIs for future well interventions with respect to remediation and inhibition. Other examples include both in-built prediction tools (hydrogen sulphide phase equilibria) and linked software such as predicting scale deposition, squeeze lifetime modelling and corrosion rate prediction. Although running with live data retrieval, the system start up included upload of all historical data, thus ensuring utility from the outset.
            This software also has new modules added which enables the analysis of sporadic operation data (e.g. stimulation pumping analysis); cumulative cost production analysis and fracturing operations. This smart system will allow an engineer to make better informed decisions based on a consistent dataset with less time spent in gathering and analyzing data. As the system retains a full flow assurance history, it can be utilized for training new employees, bringing them rapidly upto speed with well operation characteristics.
            This paper aims at describing an overall approach that has been implemented to demonstrate automated performance monitoring and analysis of operations with an intention of improving oil realization while reducing cost for these activities.},

	abstract = {Code cloning is a recurrent operation in everyday software development. Whether it is a good or bad practice is an ongoing debate among researchers and developers for the last few decades. In this paper, we conduct a comparative study on bug-proneness in clone code and non-clone code by analyzing commit logs. According to our inspection of thousands of revisions of seven diverse subject systems, the percentage of changed files due to bug-fix commits is significantly higher in clone code compared with non-clone code. We perform a Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon (MWW) test to show the statistical significance of our findings. In addition, the possibility of occurrence of severe bugs is higher in clone code than in non-clone code. Bug-fixing changes affecting clone code should be considered more carefully. Finally, our manual investigation shows that clone code containing if-condition and if–else blocks has a high risk of having severing bugs. Changes to such types of clone fragments should be done carefully during software maintenance. According to our findings, clone code appears to be more bug-prone than non-clone code.},

	abstract = {Summary
            A real-time method is presented to predict impending stuck pipe with sufficient warning to prevent it. The new method uses automated analysis of real-time modeling coupled with real-time data analysis. It can be applied to all well types for any well operation, including drilling, casing running, completion activities, and re-entries. The method uses leading indicators of stuck pipe that were identified by use of historical data sets of 36 stuck-pipe incidents in the Eagle Ford, Utica, and Permian and in the Gulf of Mexico. Two case histories show the utility of the new method in shale and carbonate horizontal wells for both drilling and off-bottom operations.
            The new method combines two types of analysis: use of hydraulics and torque-and-drag (T\&D) software to determine deviation of real-time data from the real-time model, and trend analysis (i.e., rate of change) of real-time data. Parameters used are pump pressure, flow rate, torque, rotary speed, hookload and drag, and weight on bit (WOB), along with static inputs such as bottomhole-assembly (BHA) and drillstring configuration and directional surveys. Additional parameters, such as downhole equivalent circulating density (ECD), are used when available and improve the results. But the method is designed to monitor all well types and provide a stuck-pipe-risk log even by use of only basic instrumentation. A novel algorithm predicts the probability of stuck pipe, which is presented in a real-time log.
            Results demonstrate that there is no single leading indicator in all stuck-pipe incidents. Our early-detection method, called the stuck-pipe-risk (SPR) log, relies on multiple indicators to strengthen the likelihood of detecting impending stuck pipe while avoiding false alerts. A key element to automating the process is the use of filtering for rig activity. The first indicator is deviation of actual data from model predictions. A second indicator is trend analysis (specifically, rate-of-change calculations), which provides valuable insight into rapidly deteriorating wellbore conditions when deviation from model predictions does not respond quickly enough over a short depth or time interval. Results are presented that show the SPR-detection method successfully detected impending stuck pipe on four historical shale wells an average 38 minutes before sticking and on one historical carbonate well more than 2 hours before the event. No false alerts were recorded in these wells. These results were viewed as meeting the initial goal of providing relevant alerts with sufficient time to prevent the pipe from becoming stuck.},

              Background
              Cleaning and shaping of the pulp canal is one of the most important steps of endodontic therapy. Serious complications occur by the apical extrusion of bacteria during the instrumentation procedures. Both crown-down (CD) and full-length linear motion (FM) techniques are routinely used as a component of taper rotary instrument procedures for achievement of thorough cleaning and shaping of the pulp canal space. Hence, we aimed for this study to assess the change in the amount of apically extruded bacteria using CD and FM instrumentation techniques produced by differences in taper between the instruments used during biomechanical preparation of root canals.
            
            
              Materials and methods
              
                The present study included assessments of 132 extracted maxillary central incisor teeth. To achieve a uniform teeth length of 21 mm, the height of the tooth crown was reduced for preserving the coronal portion of teeth. A modified glass vial model was constructed for the estimation of amount of bacterial extrusion through the apical region. For filling of each pulp canal specimen, 20 mL of
                Enterococcus faecalis
                suspension was used followed by the use of a number 10 K-file for carrying the bacteria down the lengths of pulp canals. All the contaminated teeth specimens were divided into six study groups with groups I to III containing specimens prepared in the CD manner, while groups IV to VI contained specimens prepared in the FM manner. Six teeth were taken as negative control with three specimens with each technique, and another six specimens were taken as positive controls. Cultivable bacterial counts were determined by evaluating 100 mL saline solution from each vial followed by its inoculation on blood agar. All the colony-forming unit (CFU) values were log-transformed (base 10), and the results were analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software.
              
            
            
              Results
              A significantly lower quantity of CFU values was observed during CD instrumentation procedures with 0.02 files in comparison with all other study groups. However, while comparing both the instrumentation procedures when different taper files, other than 0.02 taper, were used for biomechanical preparation of root canal, nonsignificant results were obtained.
            
            
              Conclusion
              With 0.02 taper preparations, significantly less amount of extrusion of bacteria is associated when done with CD technique.
            
            
              Clinical significance
              No change in the amount of apical extrusion of bacteria will be seen by changing the type of instrumentation procedures. Amount of bacteria extruded can be minimized using 0.02 taper.

	abstract = {Background: Consistency of hearing aid and remote microphone system use declines as school-age children with hearing loss age. One indicator of hearing aid use time is data logging, another is parent report. Recent data suggest that parents overestimate their children’s hearing aid use time relative to data logging. The potential reasons for this disparity remain unclear. Because school-age children spend the majority of their day away from their parents and with their teachers, reports from teachers might serve as a valuable and additional tool for estimating hearing aid use time and management.
            Purpose: This study expands previous research on factors influencing hearing aid use time in school-age children using data logging records. Discrepancies between data logging records and parent reports were explored using custom surveys designed for parents and teachers. Responses from parents and teachers were used to examine hearing aid use, remote microphone system use, and hearing aid management in school-age children.
            Study Sample: Thirteen children with mild-to-moderate hearing loss between the ages of 7 and 10 yr and their parents participated in this study. Teachers of ten of these children also participated.
            Data Collection and Analysis: Parents and teachers of children completed written surveys about each child’s hearing aid use, remote microphone system use, and hearing aid management skills. Data logs were read from hearing aids using manufacturer’s software. Multiple linear regression analysis and an intraclass correlation coefficient were used to examine factors influencing hearing aid use time and parent agreement with data logs. Parent report of hearing aid use time was compared across various activities and school and nonschool days. Survey responses from parents and teachers were compared to explore areas requiring potential improvement in audiological counseling.
            Results: Average daily hearing aid use time was ˜6 hr per day as recorded with data logging technology. Children exhibiting greater degrees of hearing loss and those with poorer vocabulary were more likely to use hearing aids consistently than children with less hearing loss and better vocabulary. Parents overestimated hearing aid use by ˜1 hr per day relative to data logging records. Parent-reported use of hearing aids varied across activities but not across school and nonschool days. Overall, parents and teachers showed excellent agreement on hearing aid and remote microphone system use during school instruction but poor agreement when asked about the child’s ability to manage their hearing devices independently.
            Conclusions: Parental reports of hearing aid use in young school-age children are largely consistent with data logging records and with teacher reports of hearing aid use in the classroom. Audiologists might find teacher reports helpful in learning more about children’s hearing aid management and remote microphone system use during their time at school. This supplementary information can serve as an additional counseling tool to facilitate discussion about remote microphone system use and hearing aid management in school-age children with hearing loss.},

As a result, it is quite challenging to manage these complex systems and meet the requirements in manageability, dependability, and performance that are demanded by enterprise customers. This survey presents a variety of data-driven techniques and applications with a focus on computing system management. In particular, the survey introduces intelligent methods for event generation that can transform diverse log data sources into structured events, reviews different types of event patterns and the corresponding event-mining techniques, and summarizes various event summarization methods and data-driven approaches for problem diagnosis in system management. We hope this survey will provide a good overview for data-driven techniques in computing system management.},

Studied outcomes included the robotic surgical error types, immediate consequences, and operative side effects. Error rate trend with time was also examined.Results: Overall robotic malfunctions were documented on the da Vinci Si systems event log in 4.97\% (61/1228) of the cases. The most common error was related to pressure sensors in the robotic arms indicating out of limit output. This recoverable fault was noted in 2.04\% (25/1228) of cases. Other errors included unrecoverable electronic communication-related in 1.06\% (13/1228) of cases, failed encoder error in 0.57\% (7/1228), illuminator-related in 0.33\% (4/1228), faulty switch in 0.24\% (3/1228), battery-related failures in 0.24\% (3/1228), and software/hardware error in 0.08\% (1/1228) of cases. Surgical delay was reported only in one patient. No conversion to either open or laparoscopic occurred secondary to robotic malfunctions. In 2015, the incidence of robotic error rose to 1.71\% (21/1228) from 0.81\% (10/1228) in 2014.Conclusions: Robotic malfunction is not infrequent in the current era of robotic surgery in various surgical subspecialties, but rarely consequential. Their seldom occurrence does not seem to affect patient safety or surgical outcome.},

	abstract = {After the 2011 East Japan Earthquake, the Japanese Cabinet Office has promoted local governments and communities to develop a “Community Disaster Management Plan.” Local governments started to hold workshops to develop the said plan for residents in local communities. However, only a few residents (i.e., those who are interested in disaster prevention) participate in these workshops; thus, most residents do not have opportunities to survey disaster prevention. Considering this issue, we decided to develop a supporting application for individual disaster management plans by analyzing hazard risks and land features. In this research, we focused on evacuation planning for residents. Furthermore, we developed it as web-based application as any resident connected to the internet may be struggling with their evacuation. In our proposed application, users have to take seven steps: (1) learn features of tsunami attack and countermeasures during a tsunami disaster, (2) set start point for evacuation, (3) set first and second goal for evacuation based on lessons learned from the “Miracle of Kamaishi,” (4) search the shortest evacuation route from start point through the first goal to the second goal, (5) review change of elevation on the evacuation route, (6) review hazard risks and land feature on the evacuation route and to reroute if necessary, and (7) download their settled evacuation route to their own devices as a GPX file. After developing a prototype of the application, we published it as a web service. While the publishing was in process, we gathered logs on how users took actions based on our proposed application. Approximately 10 days after publishing the prototype, we analyzed the path of users’ action flow, and we detected issues that need to be resolved to improve esidents’ disaster management capacity during tsunami disasters. Generally, our application helped prepared users for tsunami disaster prevention.},

	abstract = {The testing phase of mobile device products includes two important test projects that must be completed before shipment: the field trial and the beta user trial. During the field trial, the product is certified based on its integration and stability with the local operator’s system, and, during the beta user trial, the product is certified by multiple users regarding its daily use, where the goal is to detect and solve early problems. In the traditional approach used to issue returns, testers must log into a web site, fill out a problem form, and then go through a browser or FTP to upload logs; however, this is inconvenient, and problems are reported slowly. Therefore, we propose an “automatic logging analysis system” (ALAS) to construct a convenient test environment and, using a record analysis (log parser) program, automate the parsing of log files and have questions automatically sent to the database by the system. Finally, the mean time between failures (MTBF) is used to establish measurement indicators for the beta user trial.},

	abstract = {Purpose:
              
              International women’s team handball is a physically demanding sport and is intermittent in nature. The aim of the study was to profile high-intensity events (HIEs) in international women’s team handball matches with regard to playing positions.
            
            
              
                Methods:
              
              Twenty female national-team handball players were equipped with inertial movement units (OptimEye S5, Catapult Sports, Australia) in 9 official international matches. Players were categorized in 4 different playing positions: backs, wings, pivots, and goalkeepers (GKs). PlayerLoad™, accelerations (Acc), changes of direction (CoD), decelerations (Dec), and the sum of the latter 3, HIEs, were extracted from raw-data files using the manufacturer’s software. All Acc, Dec, CoD, and HIEs {\textgreater}2.5 m/s were included. Data were log-transformed and differences were standardized for interpretation of magnitudes and reported with effect-size statistics.
            
            
              
                Results:
              
              Mean numbers of events were 0.7 ± 0.4 Acc/min, 2.3 ± 0.9 Dec/min, and 1.0 ± 0.4 CoD/min. Substantial differences between playing positions, ranging from small to very large, were found in the 3 parameters. Backs showed a most likely greater frequency for HIE/min (5.0 ± 1.1 HIE/min) than all other playing positions. Differences between playing positions were also apparent in PlayerLoad/min.
            
            
              
                Conclusion:
              
              HIEs in international women’s team handball are position specific, and the overall intensity depends on the positional role within a team. Specific HIE and intensity profiles from match play provide useful information for a better understanding of the overall game demands and for each playing position.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This paper presents a case of study of cementing operations in extended reach drilling (ERD) wells on two artificial islands in UAE. The cementing objectives involved covering and isolating the shallower oil or water-bearing zone, sealing any potential crossflow interval between various reservoirs, and mitigating communication between the 13 3/8-in × 16-in. and 9 5/8-in × 12 ¼-in. annulus. Additionally, the cement will become a secondary barrier planned for the 9 5/8-in. casing to prevent potential exposure of the 13 3/8-in. casing in the event of injection gas percolation. For this case was necessary to design the cement with the necessary mechanical properties to extend the well life expectancy.
            To accomplish the operation objectives, the formations, well design complexity, and possible complications were considered. Understanding these factors facilitated the improvement in the approach and design to obtain better cementing operations results. To achieve all of the targets, various enhancements were implemented systematically over time, which included adding fiber in the cement spacer to mechanically enhance mud removal, adding corrosion inhibitor and bactericide to protect the casing if fluid remained in the well. Various lead cement slurries were designed with tailored rheology to remain within the established narrow margin between the pore pressure and fracture gradient. A flexible and expandable tail cement slurry system was implemented to increase the likelihood of proper isolation. The expansion of the tail cement slurry after the cement sets and the tailored mechanical properties used to achieve the necessary resilience, provide support for the stresses encountered during the life of the well. Upgraded properties, such as fluid loss, reduced permeability, and static gel strength (SGS) development, were used to mitigate possible influx between formations. Both cement slurries were loaded with resilient fiber to enhance the cement ductility. These strategies combined with software simulations enabled equivalent circulating density (ECD) management, contamination avoidance, friction pressure hierarchy, discernment of the top of cement (TOC), determination of possible channels, and appropriate stand-off design.
            The application of the solutions combined with outstanding consistent field operational performance enabled the following: Fine-tuning various practices, improving isolation across critical zones, achieving the planned TOC, sealing the formations that could create potential future issues, and reducing the probability of interzonal communication or crossflow. A systematic approach was necessary to achieve all the objectives in these challenging wells and determine which practices and technologies provide the appropriate results.
            Cementing ERD wells with the challenges previously described is not a standard industry practice. This case study presents the staged application of the enhancements that improved the cementing results. These were inferred by evaluating the operational parameters (density, pumping rate, pressure, volumes, and surface returns) in conjunction with the availability of cement logs (CBL, VDL, ULTRASONIC). The results demonstrated the capability to achieve isolation; Furthermore, the continuous annulus surveillance showed no undesirable sustained casing pressure.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, Information and communications technology (ICT) becomes a very important thing in human life in different fields. They are used in many fields as information systems (software, middleware) using various telecommunication media to give users the ability to manipulate digital data. In addition, with new technology development, a new concept appeared in the late 90s and early millennium, which is distance learning through e-Learning platform. Recommendation systems become increasingly used in information systems and especially in e-learning platform. These systems are used to propose and recommend content of these platforms to users according to needs of the latter in order to allow them to have the maximum information for learning. 
In this paper, we present an intelligent hybrid recommendation system based on data mining. This system has four parts, the first for data collection and for center of interest construction by two modes: explicit data collection, which based on users and what they filled in their profiles, and implicit and automatic data collection by proposing a survey to users in order to gather information about their interest. A second part for processing information already collected in the previous part and for creating the learning model, classifying users who posted the content and classifying content also in order to send the results to the recommendation module. The third part is for making the similarity between learners and content and doing the recommendation for learners and the final part is for creating a log file of recommendation by learner, which will be used in the upcoming recommendation. According to results already done, we noticed that our proposition is satisfactory and the system is well optimized in terms of accuracy, response and processing time compared to the standard recommendation.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              – The purpose of this paper is to decrease the traffic created by search engines’ crawlers and solve the deep web problem using an innovative approach.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              – A new algorithm was formulated based on best existing algorithms to optimize the existing traffic caused by web crawlers, which is approximately 40 percent of all networking traffic. The crux of this approach is that web servers monitor and log changes and communicate them as an XML file to search engines. The XML file includes the information necessary to generate refreshed pages from existing ones and reference new pages that need to be crawled. Furthermore, the XML file is compressed to decrease its size to the minimum required.
            
            
              Findings
              – The results of this study have shown that the traffic caused by search engines’ crawlers might be reduced on average by 84 percent when it comes to text content. However, binary content faces many challenges and new algorithms have to be developed to overcome these issues. The proposed approach will certainly mitigate the deep web issue. The XML files for each domain used by search engines might be used by web browsers to refresh their cache and therefore help reduce the traffic generated by normal users. This reduces users’ perceived latency and improves response time to http requests.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              – The study sheds light on the deficiencies and weaknesses of the algorithms monitoring changes and generating binary files. However, a substantial decrease of traffic is achieved for text-based web content.
            
            
              Practical implications
              – The findings of this research can be adopted by web server software and browsers’ developers and search engine companies to reduce the internet traffic caused by crawlers and cut costs.
            
            
              Originality/value
              – The exponential growth of web content and other internet-based services such as cloud computing, and social networks has been causing contention on available bandwidth of the internet network. This research provides a much needed approach to keeping traffic in check.},

Moreover, it has become possible to obtain a surface reconstruction of a realistic 3D model using high-overlap images and 3D modeling software such as Context capture, Pix4Dmapper, Photoscan based on computer vision technology such as structure from motion and multi-view stereo. 3D modeling software has many applications. However, most of them seem to not have obtained appropriate accuracy control in accordance with the knowledge of photogrammetry and/or computer vision. Therefore, we performed flight tests in a test field using an UAV equipped with a gimbal stabilizer and consumer grade digital camera. Our UAV is a hexacopter and can fly according to the waypoints for autonomous flight and can record flight logs. We acquired images from different altitudes such as 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m. We obtained 3D reconstruction results of orthoimages, point clouds, and textured TIN models for accuracy evaluation in some cases with different image scale conditions using 3D modeling software. Moreover, the accuracy aspect was evaluated for different units of input image—course unit and flight unit. This paper describes the fundamental accuracy evaluation for 3D modeling using UAV imagery and 3D modeling software from the viewpoint of close-range photogrammetry.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            A real-time method is presented to predict impending stuck pipe with sufficient warning to prevent it. The new method uses automated analysis of real-time modeling coupled with real-time data analysis. It can be applied to all well types for any well operation including drilling, casing running, completion activities, and re-entries. The method uses leading indicators of stuck pipe that were identified using historical data sets of 36 stuck pipe incidents in the Eagle Ford, Utica, Permian, and Gulf of Mexico. Four case histories show the utility of the new method in four shale horizontal wells for both drilling and off-bottom operations.
            The new method combines two types of analysis: (1) deviation of real-time data from real-time model predictions using hydraulics and torque and drag (T\&D) software, and (2) trend analysis (i.e., rate of change) of real-time data. Parameters used are pump pressure, flow rate, torque, rotary speed, hookload and drag, and weight on bit along with static inputs such as BHA and drillstring configuration and directional surveys. Additional parameters such as downhole ECD are used when available and improve the results. But the method is designed to monitor all well types and provide a stuck-pipe-risk log even using only basic instrumentation. A novel algorithm predicts the probability of stuck pipe which is presented in a real-time log.
            Results demonstrate there is no single leading indicator present in all stuck pipe incidents. Consequently, relying on a single specific pattern (such as increasing pump pressure at constant flow rate) leads to inability to predict stuck pipe in some cases. Our early detection method relies on multiple indicators to strengthen the likelihood of detecting an increase in stuck pipe while avoiding false alerts. Deviations of parameters from model predictions have been used with success in the past by experts but the new method provides contextual awareness and provides thresholds that automate the process. A key element is the use of filtering for rig activity. Rate of change calculations provide valuable insight into rapidly deteriorating wellbore conditions when deviation from model predictions does not respond quickly enough over a short depth or time interval. The detection method was tested on four historical wells in which four stuck pipe and two near-miss events occurred. Testing showed that an alert was generated, on average, 38 minutes before the event. There were no false alerts recorded in these wells.},

	abstract = {PhilDB is an open-source time series database that supports storage of time series datasets that are dynamic; that is, it records updates to existing values in a log as they occur. PhilDB eases loading of data for the user by utilising an intelligent data write method. It preserves existing values during updates and abstracts the update complexity required to achieve logging of data value changes. It implements fast reads to make it practical to select data for analysis. Recent open-source systems have been developed to indefinitely store long-period high-resolution time series data without change logging. Unfortunately, such systems generally require a large initial installation investment before use because they are designed to operate over a cluster of servers to achieve high-performance writing of static data in real time. In essence, they have a ‘big data’ approach to storage and access. Other open-source projects for handling time series data that avoid the ‘big data’ approach are also relatively new and are complex or incomplete. None of these systems gracefully handle revision of existing data while tracking values that change. Unlike ‘big data’ solutions, PhilDB has been designed for single machine deployment on commodity hardware, reducing the barrier to deployment. PhilDB takes a unique approach to meta-data tracking; optional attribute attachment. This facilitates scaling the complexities of storing a wide variety of data. That is, it allows time series data to be loaded as time series instances with minimal initial meta-data, yet additional attributes can be created and attached to differentiate the time series instances when a wider variety of data is needed. PhilDB was written in Python, leveraging existing libraries. While some existing systems come close to meeting the needs PhilDB addresses, none cover all the needs at once. PhilDB was written to fill this gap in existing solutions. This paper explores existing time series database solutions, discusses the motivation for PhilDB, describes the architecture and philosophy of the PhilDB software, and performs an evaluation between InfluxDB, PhilDB, and SciDB.},

	abstract = {We present a command, penlogit, for approximate Bayesian logistic regression using penalized likelihood estimation via data augmentation. This command automatically adds specific prior-data records to a dataset. These records are computed so that they generate a penalty function for the log likelihood of a logistic model, which equals (up to an additive constant) a set of independent log prior distributions on the model parameters. This command overcomes the necessity of relying on specialized software and statistical tools (such as Markov chain Monte Carlo) for fitting Bayesian models, and allows one to assess the information content of a prior in terms of the data that would be required to generate the prior as a likelihood function. The command produces data equivalent to normal and generalized log- F priors for the model parameters, providing flexible translation of background information into prior data, which allows calculation of approximate posterior medians and intervals from ordinary maximum likelihood programs. We illustrate the command through an example using data from an observational study of neonatal mortality.},

	abstract = {One of the critical success factors of e-learning is positive interest of students towards e-learning. The majority of activities of current e-learning usage are viewing and downloading. These activities are not meaningful with regard to enhancing learning quality. Due to that, the aim of this paper is to analyze students’ usage based on meaningful learning characteristics by clustering students’ activities and actions during online learning. We first define meaningful learning characteristics (as those which are active, authentic, cooperative, collaborative, and intentional) and associate these with e-learning activities and actions. Then, we analyze the students’ e-learning usage and define the cluster of student’s meaningful characteristics by using the K-Means cluster method. A case study has been conducted based on the e-learning log files of 37 students on Computational Intelligence Course at the Software Engineering Department, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. The result of this clustering enables us to determine the students with high ratings on these meaningful activities and actions during online learning. We found out that students with high hits on add, update, and edit are included in the high cluster group. On the contrary, students with high hits on the view actions for all e-learning activities are included in the low cluster group. This result may assist instructors while preparing the strategy of computer usage for education, in terms of providing a greater variety of learning activities, which is applicable for any courses.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the epidemiology of traumatic dentoalveolar injuries (TDI) in dogs and cats and to evaluate the applicability of a human classification system for TDI in dogs and cats. All patients diagnosed with a TDI were identified from the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine Dentistry and Oral Surgery Service case log and the hospital patient processing software. The study population consisted of 621 dogs and cats, in a total of 660 patient visits from 2004 to 2012, admitted for oral treatment and subsequently diagnosed with at least one TDI. Medical records including diagnostic imaging studies were reviewed to group the injury according to a classification system used in humans for TDI. Patient signalment, tooth injured, and number of injuries per patient were recorded and tabulated. The overall prevalence of TDI was 26.2\%. The mean +/− SD number of TDI per patient was 1.45 +/− 0.85. All 14 classes of TDI recognized by the classification system utilized in humans were identified, and all (100\%) TDI identified in this study were classifiable using this system. Enamel-dentin-pulp fracture was the most common TDI (49.6\%). The most commonly injured teeth were the mandibular or maxillary canine teeth (35.5\%). The most common age for dogs and cats with TDI were 3–6 years (33.0\%) and 7–10 years (31.3\%). With a frequency of 1 in 4 animals, TDI are common and represent a significant pet health concern. Most TDI are considered severe and require timely, and sometimes immediate, treatment. The adoption and utilization of a complete classification system, such as the one used in this study, is recommended in order to improve future epidemiological study of TDI in animals.},

Most of the previous studies on logging analysis and prediction provide insights and results after analyzing only a few code constructs. In this paper, the authors perform an in-depth and large-scale analysis of logging code constructs at two levels. They answer nine research questions related to statistical and content analysis. Statistical analysis at file level reveals that fewer files consist of log statements but logged files have a greater complexity than that of non-logged files. Results show that a positive correlation exists between size and logging count of the logged files. Statistical analysis on catch-blocks show that try-blocks associated with logged catch-blocks have greater complexity than non-logged catch-blocks and the logging ratio of an exception type is project specific. Content-based analysis of catch-blocks reveals the presence of different topics in try-blocks associated with logged and non-logged catch-blocks.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              – This paper aims to present a solution that enables organizations to monitor and analyse the performance of their business processes by means of Big Data technology. Business process improvement can drastically influence in the profit of corporations and helps them to remain viable. However, the use of traditional Business Intelligence systems is not sufficient to meet today
					'
				s business needs. They normally are business domain-specific and have not been sufficiently process-aware to support the needs of process improvement-type activities, especially on large and complex supply chains, where it entails integrating, monitoring and analysing a vast amount of dispersed event logs, with no structure, and produced on a variety of heterogeneous environments. This paper tackles this variability by devising different Big-Data-based approaches that aim to gain visibility into process performance.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              – Authors present a cloud-based solution that leverages (BD) technology to provide essential insights into business process improvement. The proposed solution is aimed at measuring and improving overall business performance, especially in very large and complex cross-organisational business processes, where this type of visibility is hard to achieve across heterogeneous systems.
            
            
              Findings
              – Three different (BD) approaches have been undertaken based on Hadoop and HBase. We introduced first, a map-reduce approach that it is suitable for batch processing and presents a very high scalability. Secondly, we have described an alternative solution by integrating the proposed system with Impala. This approach has significant improvements in respect with map reduce as it is focused on performing real-time queries over HBase. Finally, the use of secondary indexes has been also proposed with the aim of enabling immediate access to event instances for correlation in detriment of high duplication storage and synchronization issues. This approach has produced remarkable results in two real functional environments presented in the paper.
            
            
              Originality/value
              – The value of the contribution relies on the comparison and integration of software packages towards an integrated solution that is aimed to be adopted by industry. Apart from that, in this paper, authors illustrate the deployment of the architecture in two different settings.},

            Reservoir simulation engineers have to go through an intense and time consuming process to manually quality check large amounts of data which consist of wells, logs and completion events for more than 50 years of history. It is fundamental that data used in building reservoir simulation models is quality controlled and cross-checked to eliminate inconsistencies during the history match process.
            This new implemented method will give an overview of the simulation data quality workflow design and outline the development of a state of the art software package that guides engineers through the quality checking process as the first stage of simulation model construction.
            We have developed a workflow software package that covers most of the data required for building simulation models. The preparation and validation of data is conducted using tailored automated workflows that guide engineers through the quality control steps in a streamlined manner. At every step, specific data is reviewed and validated based on some well-developed quality check (QC) criteria. In case of any inconsistencies, the software issues relevant error and warning messages and recommends possible remedial solutions or actions.
            This tool eliminates tedious manual nonformal effort and results in high-quality simulation models checked and verified through formal and automated workflows, therefore. The new workflow/software reduces the checking process from weeks to days or hours and hence minimizes the overall time to perform history matching.},

	abstract = {Summary
            Background: Preoperative assessments are a required and essential element of anesthetic care, yet little is known about the utilization of these documents by clinicians who are not part of the anesthesia care team. As part of perioperative workflow restructuring, we implemented a data visualization technique of electronic medical record audit log data to understand the utilization of preoperative anesthesia assessments by non-anesthesia personnel.
            Methods: An audit log cache containing 140 days of data was queried for all accesses of preoperative anesthesia assessment documents for any patient who had a preoperative anesthesia assessment that was accessed during that period. User roles were aggregated into categories. Descriptive statistics and data visualization were generated using R (R Software Foundation, Vienna, Austria). Comparisons were performed with the Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction.
            Results: During the study period, 73 802 (0.015\%) of the 485 062 902 audit log accesses were pre-operative anesthesia assessments representing 412 departments, 302 user roles, and 3 916 distinct users who accessed preoperative anesthesia assessments from 14 235 surgical cases. Each assessment was accessed 2.9 times on average. Assessments performed in the preoperative anesthesia assessment clinic were accessed more frequently than those created on the day of surgery in the preoperative holding room (3.58 ± 5.18 v. 1.98 ± 1.76 average views; p{\textless}0.0001). We observed accesses of these documents by pathology and general surgery researchers, as well as orthopedics attending physicians accessing documents that were two years old.
            Conclusions: This approach revealed patterns of utilization that had not been previously identified, including usage by surgical residents, surgical faculty, and pathology researchers both before and after the surgical event for which the documents are generated. Knowledge of these dependencies directly informed perioperative workflow restructuring efforts. This visual analytic approach could be broadly utilized to understand documentation dependencies in a variety of clinical contexts.},

	abstract = {Emerging byte-addressable, non-volatile memory technologies (NVRAM) like phase-change memory can increase the capacity of future memory systems by orders of magnitude. Compared to systems that rely on disk storage, NVRAM-based systems promise significant improvements in performance for key applications like online transaction processing (OLTP). Unfortunately, NVRAM systems suffer from two drawbacks: their asymmetric read-write performance and the notable higher cost of the new memory technologies compared to disk. This paper investigates the cost-effective use of NVRAM in transaction systems. It shows that using NVRAM only for the logging subsystem (
              NV-Logging
              ) provides much higher transactions per dollar than simply replacing all disk storage with NVRAM. Specifically, for
              NV-Logging
              , we show that the software overheads associated with centralized log buffers cause performance bottlenecks and limit scaling. The per-transaction logging methods described in the paper help avoid these overheads, enabling concurrent logging for multiple transactions. Experimental results with a faithful emulation of future NVRAM-based servers using the TPCC, TATP, and TPCB benchmarks show that
              NV-Logging
              improves throughput by 1.42 - 2.72x over the costlier option of replacing all disk storage with NVRAM. Results also show that
              NV-Logging
              performs 1.21 - 6.71x better than when logs are placed into the PMFS NVRAM-optimized file system. Compared to state-of-the-art distributed logging,
              NV-Logging
              delivers 20.4\% throughput improvements.},

            The paper illustrates the approach to the formation of technological and instrumental base for selection of the optimal strategy to prepare the field for full-scale development and planning program of exploration plan/ experimental program, based on the example of multilayer field, including oil and gas condensate layers, differing in state of knowledge, conditions of sedimentation, reservoir properties, fluid properties, initial thermobaric conditions.
            Several exploration wells were drilled on the field, the area is covered with 3D seismic, the set of well logs was carried out (including modern methods), the core was picked and analyzed, the wells were tested using exploration plan and experimental program.
            The main purpose is to estimate geological and technological uncertainties and risks, and associated with them possible ranges of reserves and production levels. An algorithm for solving this problem included: review of the various options of geological structure, taking into account identified uncertainties, estimation of various development scenarios, taking into account technological risks separately for oil and gas reservoirs, and for the field as a whole.
            Peculiarity of the work is the aggregation of modern technologies of modeling variability of the geological structure, filtration processes, estimation of key risks calculatingly of technical and economic indicators for each of the scenarios. As a result, against the background of negative economic indicators of field development, obtained according base scenario of development, it was detected that it is possible to use of current uncertainties and risks on the field as a tool to find alternative scenarios of economically viable development plans. Such approach, in case of confirmation in each scenario of hypotheses leads to increase of overall efficiency of the project. Based on the probability of confirmation of such scenarios, the strategy of exploration plan and experimental program of the field is formed, including the drilling of exploratory wells, their research, analytical and laboratory works. The program is presented in the form of a decision tree, allowing to see the course of events on "a step forward", depending on the result.
            An integrated approach has allowed to optimize the program of exploration plan and experimental program: the amount of information needed to make decisions, received with fewer new exploration wells, that allowed to reduce the capital expenditures on the exploration plan and experimental program.},

	abstract = {Most deconvolution algorithms try to transform the seismic wavelet into spikes by designing inverse filters that remove an estimated seismic wavelet from seismic data. We assume that seismic trace subtle discontinuities are associated with acoustic impedance contrasts and can be characterized by wavelet transform spectral ridges, also called modulus maxima lines (WTMML), allowing us to improve seismic resolution by using the wavelet transform. Specifically, we apply the complex Morlet continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to each seismic trace and compute the WTMMLs. Then, we reconstruct the seismic trace with the inverse continuous wavelet transform from the computed WTMMLs with a broader band complex Morlet wavelet than that used in the forward CWT. Because the reconstruction process preserves amplitude and phase along different scales, or frequencies, the result looks like a deconvolution method. Considering this high-resolution seismic representation as a reflectivity approximation, we estimate the relative acoustic impedance (RAI) by filtering and trace integrating it. Conventional deconvolution algorithms assume the seismic wavelet to be stochastic, while the CWT is implicitly time varying such that it can be applied to both depth and time-domain data. Using synthetic and real seismic data, we evaluated the effectiveness of the methodology on detecting seismic events associated with acoustic impedance changes. In the real data examples, time and in-depth RAI results, show good correlation with real P-impedance band-pass data computed using more rigorous commercial inversion software packages that require well logs and low-frequency velocity model information.},

	abstract = {The increasing number of units in today's systems-on-chip and multicore processors has led to complex intra-chip communication solutions. Specifically, Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) have emerged as a favorable fabric to provide high bandwidth and low latency in connecting many units in a same chip. To achieve these goals, the NoC often includes complex components and advanced features, leading to the development of large and highly complex interconnect subsystems. One of the biggest challenges in these designs is to ensure the correct functionality of this communication infrastructure. To support this goal, an increasing fraction of the validation effort has shifted to post-silicon validation, because it permits exercising network activities that are too complex to be validated in pre-silicon. However, post-silicon validation is hindered by the lack of observability of the network's internal operations and thus, diagnosing functional errors during this phase is very difficult.
            In this work, we propose a post-silicon validation platform that improves observability of network operations by taking periodic snapshots of the traffic traversing the network. Each node's local cache is configured to temporarily store the snapshot logs in a designated area reserved for post-silicon validation and relinquished after product release. Each snapshot log is analyzed locally by a software algorithm running on its corresponding core, in order to detect functional errors. Upon error detection, all snapshot logs are aggregated at a central location to extract additional debug data, including an overview of network traffic surrounding the error event, as well as a partial reconstruction of the routes followed by packets in flight at the time. In our experiments, we found that this approach allows us to detect several types of functional errors, as well as observe, on average, over 50\% of the network's traffic and reconstruct at least half of each of their routes through the network.},

By establishing task file transmission queue quickly, and making use of fault recovery module, fast task queue management software not only recovers files effectively which transfer failed unexpectedly, but also realizes saving and restoring rapidly in file transfer system. The software has three functions: the file status real-time monitoring, reading the breakpoint recovery and system log. Test results show that the software improves the efficiency of task management and builds task lists quickly. It also recovers task queue to the breakpoints quickly which are failed to execute at the last time, and continues to perform the task when a fault occurs in the task queue. The software runs steadily , especially , the design idea of the software which has great value in engineering application is instructive.},

	abstract = {In real-time interactive data analytics, the user expects to receive the results of each query within a short time period such as seconds. This is especially challenging when the data is big (e.g., on the scale of petabytes), and the analytics system runs on top of cloud infrastructure (e.g., thousands of interconnected commodity servers). We have been building such a system, called OceanRT, for managing large spatio-temporal data such as call logs and mobile web browsing records collected by a telecommunication company. Although there already exist systems for querying big data in real time, OceanRT's performance stands out due to several novel designs and components that address key efficiency and scalability issues that were largely overlooked in existing systems. First, OceanRT makes extensive use of software RDMA one-sided operations, which reduce networking costs without requiring specialized hardware. Second, OceanRT exploits the parallel computing capabilities of each node in the cloud through a novel architecture consisting of Access-Query Engines (AQEs) connected with minimal overhead. Third, OceanRT contains a novel storage scheme that optimizes for queries with joins and multi-dimensional selections, which are common for large spatio-temporal data. Experiments using the TPC-DS benchmark show that OceanRT is usually more than an order of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art systems.},

Although cloud computing is convenient for users, detecting and preventing possible security breaches remains an unsolved problem. Security logs are critical data that indicate events in an operating system or other software, and these data are stored through heterogeneous machines such as network security devices, server systems, and database management systems (DBMS). However, existing methods can create problems for efficient analysis because of large-scale heterogeneous security logs in the cloud-computing environment. Therefore, because cloud computing provides various services to users, an efficient integration method of security logs must be developed. This study proposes a NoSQL-based method to collect and integrate security logs using MapReduce. Our study shows that log data were reduced by more than 87\% when integrating duplicate large-scale security logs. This proposed method provides faster data storage than conventional DBMS and is more effective.},

	abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is one of the principal xenobiotic, nuclear receptor that is responsible for the early events involved in the transcription of a complex set of genes comprising the CYP450 gene family. In the present computational study, homology modelling and molecular docking were carried out with the objective of predicting the relationship between the binding efficiency and the lipophilicity of different polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and the AHR in silico. Homology model of the murine AHR was constructed by several automated servers and assessed by PROCHECK, ERRAT, VERIFY3D and WHAT IF. The resulting model of the AHR by MODWEB was used to carry out molecular docking of 36 PCB congeners using PatchDock server. The lipophilicity of the congeners was predicted using the XLOGP3 tool. The results suggest that the lipophilicity influences binding energy scores and is positively correlated with the same. Score and Log P were correlated with r = +0.506 at p = 0.01 level. In addition, the number of chlorine (Cl) atoms and Log P were highly correlated with r = +0.900 at p = 0.01 level. The number of Cl atoms and scores also showed a moderate positive correlation of r = +0.481 at p = 0.01 level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study employing PatchDock in the docking of AHR to the environmentally deleterious congeners and attempting to correlate structural features of the AHR with its biochemical properties with regards to PCBs. The result of this study are consistent with those of other computational studies reported in the previous literature that suggests that a combination of docking, scoring and ranking organic pollutants could be a possible predictive tool for investigating ligand-mediated toxicity, for their subsequent validation using wet lab-based studies.},

As of September 2012 the dataset comprises over 2.3 TB, 38 h and 42 km (the length of a marathon). The dataset is of particular interest to robotics and computer vision researchers interested in long-term autonomy. It is expected to be useful in a variety of research areas—robotic mapping (long-term, visual, RGB-D or laser), change detection in indoor environments, human pattern analysis, long-term path planning. For ease of use the original ROS ‘bag’ log files are provided and also a derivative version combining human readable data and imagery in standard formats. Of particular importance, this dataset also includes ground-truth position estimates of the robot at every instance (to typical accuracy of 2 cm) using as-built floor-plans—which were carefully extracted using our software tools. The provision of ground-truth for such a large dataset enables more meaningful comparison between algorithms than has previously been possible.},

The motivation is to develop a PC-based monitoring system for not only CAN frames received from or sent onto CAN bus, but also data recorded on log files consideration. This paper presents a prototype monitoring system on automotive CAN bus gauge for communication protocol in Ford Mustang. For the proposed CAN bus monitoring system, the designed architecture is discussed and verified into PC for surveillance performance. Furthermore the Ethernet technology adopted in the system makes it a more practical and convenient CAN bus testing system.},

	abstract = {We present Dora, a mutable record-replay system which allows a recorded execution of an application to be replayed with a modified version of the application. This feature, not available in previous record-replay systems, enables powerful new functionality. In particular, Dora can help reproduce, diagnose, and fix software bugs by replaying a version of a recorded application that is recompiled with debugging information, reconfigured to produce verbose log output, modified to include additional print statements, or patched to fix a bug.
            Dora uses lightweight operating system mechanisms to record an application execution by capturing nondeterministic events to a log without imposing unnecessary timing and ordering constraints. It replays the log using a modified version of the application even in the presence of added, deleted, or modified operations that do not match events in the log. Dora searches for a replay that minimizes differences between the log and the replayed execution of the modified program. If there are no modifications, Dora provides deterministic replay of the unmodified program.
            We have implemented a Linux prototype which provides transparent mutable replay without recompiling or relinking applications. We show that Dora is useful for reproducing, diagnosing, and fixing software bugs in real-world applications, including Apache and MySQL. Our results show that Dora (1) captures bugs and replays them with applications modified or reconfigured to produce additional debugging output for root cause diagnosis, (2) captures exploits and replays them with patched applications to validate that the patches successfully eliminate vulnerabilities, (3) records production workloads and replays them with patched applications to validate patches with realistic workloads, and (4) maintains low recording overhead on commodity multicore hardware, making it suitable for production systems.},

	abstract = {Full-system emulation has been an extremely useful tool in developing and debugging systems software like operating systems and hypervisors. However, current full-system emulators lack the support for deterministic replay, which limits the reproducibility of concurrency bugs that is indispensable for analyzing and debugging the essentially multi-threaded systems software.
            This paper analyzes the challenges in supporting deterministic replay in parallel full-system emulators and makes a comprehensive study on the sources of non-determinism. Unlike application-level replay systems, our system, called ReEmu, needs to log sources of non-determinism in both the guest software stack and the dynamic binary translator for faithful replay. To provide scalable and efficient record and replay on multicore machines, ReEmu makes several notable refinements to the CREW protocol that replays shared memory systems. First, being aware of the performance bottlenecks in frequent lock operations in the CREW protocol, ReEmu refines the CREW protocol with a seqlock-like design, to avoid serious contention and possible starvation in instrumentation code tracking dependence of racy accesses on a shared memory object. Second, to minimize the required log files, ReEmu only logs minimal local information regarding accesses to a shared memory location, but instead relies on an offline log processing tool to derive precise shared memory dependence for faithful replay. Third, ReEmu adopts an automatic lock clustering mechanism that clusters a set of uncontended memory objects to a bulk to reduce the frequencies of lock operations, which noticeably boost performance.
            Our prototype ReEmu is based on our open-source COREMU system and supports scalable and efficient record and replay of full-system environments (both x64 and ARM). Performance evaluation shows that ReEmu has very good performance scalability on an Intel multicore machine. It incurs only 68.9\% performance overhead on average (ranging from 51.8\% to 94.7\%) over vanilla COREMU to record five PARSEC benchmarks running on a 16-core emulated system.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Lidar has the ability to detect the complex vertical structure of the atmosphere and can therefore identify the existence and extent of aerosols with high spatial and temporal resolution, making it well suited for understanding atmospheric dynamics and transport processes. Environment Canada has developed a portable, autonomous lidar system that can be monitored remotely and operated continuously except during precipitation events. The lidar, housed in a small trailer, simultaneously emits two wavelengths of laser light (1064 nm and 532 nm) at energies of approximately 150 mJ/pulse/wavelength and detects the backscatter signal at 1064 nm and both polarizations at 532 nm. For laser energies of this magnitude, the challenge resides in designing a system that meets the airspace safety requirements for autonomous operations. Through the combination of radar technology, beam divergence, laser cavity interlocks and using computer log files, this risk was mitigated. A Continuum Inlite small footprint laser is the backbone of the system because of three design criteria: requiring infrequent flash lamp changes compared to previous Nd : YAG Q-switch lasers, complete software control capability and a built-in laser energy monitoring system. A computer-controlled interface was designed to monitor the health of the system, adjust operational parameters and maintain a climate-controlled environment. Through an Internet connection, it also transmitted the vital performance indicators and data stream to allow the lidar profile data for multiple instruments from near ground to 15 km, every 10 s, to be viewed, in near real-time via a website. The details of the system design and calibration will be discussed and the success of the instrument as tested within the framework of a national lidar network dubbed CORALNet (Canadian Operational Research Aerosol Lidar Network). In addition, the transport of a forest fire plume across the country will be shown as evidenced by the lidar network, HYSPLIT back trajectories, MODIS imagery and CALIPSO overpasses.},

	abstract = {The joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data has received remarkable attention in the methodological literature over the past decade; however, the availability of software to implement the methods lags behind. The most common form of joint model assumes that the association between the survival and the longitudinal processes is underlined by shared random effects. As a result, computationally intensive numerical integration techniques such as adaptive Gauss–Hermite quadrature are required to evaluate the likelihood. We describe a new user-written command, stjm, that allows the user to jointly model a continuous longitudinal response and the time to an event of interest. We assume a linear mixed-effects model for the longitudinal submodel, allowing flexibility through the use of fixed or random fractional polynomials of time. Four choices are available for the survival submodel: the exponential, Weibull or Gompertz proportional hazard models, and the flexible parametric model (stpm2). Flexible parametric models are fit on the log cumulative-hazard scale, which has direct computational benefits because it avoids the use of numerical integration to evaluate the cumulative hazard. We describe the features of stjm through application to a dataset investigating the effect of serum bilirubin level on time to death from any cause in 312 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.},

	abstract = {Background: Obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and a confirmed cause of ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and atherosclerosis, all of which are predisposing factors of heart failure (HF). HF and various other chronic diseases can also induce systemic inflammation response syndrome. This inflammatory condition causes poor nutritional status, cachexia, and unfavorable disease prognoses. However, this obesity paradox has not been verified in Asian populations. Clarifying the effect of obesity on HF prognoses can help healthcare professionals improve HF patient nutritional care. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to monitor and compare disparities in heart‐related events (e.g., unscheduled medical visits, hospitalization, and death) over a 12‐month period among an HF patient population with varying body masses. Methods: This study adopted a prospective long‐term follow‐up research method. The 125 participants were symptomatic patients diagnosed with chronic heart failure (CHF) based on echocardiography results. Patient height, weight, and disease data were measured and monthly telephone interviews were conducted with each patient for 12 months in order to understand the nature of their inpatient and unscheduled outpatient visits. Patients were assigned into 3 body mass index (BMI) groups, including obese (30 to 45 kg/m{\textasciicircum}2), overweight (25 to 29.9 kg/m{\textasciicircum}2), and normal/underweight (17 to 24.9 kg/m{\textasciicircum}2) groups. Prognosis results for the 3 groups were compared and data were entered into SPSS software. The Kaplan‐Meier survival curve then examined participant disease outcomes. Results: Possible predictors correlated to survival included age (65‐year‐old group), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; 40\% group), HF classifications announced by the New York Heart Association (NYHA Class III/IV vs. Class I/II), and BMI. Log‐rank test results suggested that patients who had an LVEF lower than 40\% (350.8 ± 18.6 vs. 508.3 ± 46.6 d, p = .001), were diagnosed with NYHA‐based Class III/IV HF (326.6 ± 23.2 vs. 496.6 ± 42.4 days, p ＜ .001), or had a BMI in the normal/underweight range (371.3 ± 18.8 d) had a relatively shorter life expectancy and higher mortality risk. Results further indicated that, overall, BMI caused significant differences among group outcomes (p for log‐rank test = .006 with 2 df). Post‐hoc test results suggested that life expectancy for normal/underweight group participants was shorter than for overweight and obese group participants (p for normal/underweight vs. overweight = .008; p for normal/underweight vs. obese = .044). Conclusion / Practical Implications: Disease prognoses for normal and underweight HF patients were unfavorable compared to those of overweight patients. In other words, hospitalizations and deaths of normal and underweight HF patients occurred earlier. This study recommends that clinical practitioners dismiss the stereotype that obesity only negatively impacts the cardiovascular system, as our results indicate that reducing or maintaining body mass may not benefit HF patient prognoses.Background: Obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and a confirmed cause of ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and atherosclerosis, all of which are predisposing factors of heart failure (HF).

	abstract = {Architectures for deterministic record-replay (R\&R) of multithreaded code are attractive for program debugging, intrusion analysis, and fault-tolerance uses. However, very few of the proposed designs have focused on maximizing replay speed -- a key enabling property of these systems. The few efforts that focus on replay speed require intrusive hardware or software modifications, or target whole-system R\&R rather than the more useful application-level R\&R.
            
              This paper presents the first hardware-based scheme for unintrusive, application-level R\&R that explicitly targets high replay speed. Our scheme, called
              Cyrus
              , requires no modification to commodity snoopy cache coherence. It introduces the concept of an on-the-fly software Backend Pass during recording which, as the log is being generated, transforms it for high replay parallelism. This pass also fixes-up the log, and can flexibly trade-off replay parallelism for log size. We analyze the performance of Cyrus using full system (OS plus hardware) simulation. Our results show that Cyrus has negligible recording overhead. In addition, for 8-processor runs of SPLASH-2, Cyrus attains an average replay parallelism of 5, and a replay speed that is, on average, only about 50\% lower than the recording speed.},

            Wellbore temperature logs and associated field history data from an HPHT condensate North Sea platform are presented which validate the accuracy of a transient model of multiwell thermal interaction. The model is an updated version of previous work which simulates transient thermal interaction or "cross-heating" between closely spaced wells of a template. Multiwell thermal interaction alters final wellbore temperatures as well as formation temperatures in the inter-well zone and also further out from the well template. The multiwell thermal model is shown to converge closely in very characteristic fashion to two different logged and measured temperature profiles over a vertical depth range of 3000 ft.
            The empirical data including field history represents a unique opportunity to study and understand this important topic. Prior to this current work, industry discussion of multiwell thermal interaction or "cross-heating" has been largely anecdotal. Model validation against field data is necessary to achieve a full understanding of the physical system and to provide confidence in the predictive capability.
            Modeling of wellbore and formation temperatures for closely spaced wells has not been widely examined in the industry literature. The current work presents an improved methodology based on standard industry techniques. The method employs standard industry thermal-hydraulic modeling software and a fully transient finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) model in a loosely-coupled, iterative analysis. The iteration scheme is achieved by coupling of the standard analytical solution for the isolated single-well temperature scenario with the solution in the formation for the cross-heating scenario.
            The effect of multiwell thermal interaction is important for closely-spaced wells such as offshore platforms or subsea and arctic developments. The multiwell disturbance on formation and wellbore temperatures may affect well design, facilities planning and operations. Annular pressure build-up (APB), wellhead movement, tubular stress design, cement slurry design, subsidence/compaction effects and facilities health and safety issues can all be affected. If multiwell thermal interaction is not taken into account, then load events such as APB, wellhead movement and thermal induced stresses may be underestimated. Concurrent and batch drilling operations including cementation will also be affected.},

            Wellbore-temperature logs and associated field-history data from a high-pressure/high-temperature (HP/HT) condensate North Sea platform are presented that validate the accuracy of a transient model of the multiwell thermal interaction (MWTI). The model is an updated version of previous work by McSpadden and Coker (2010) that simulates transient thermal interaction or "cross heating" between closely spaced wells of a template. As discussed in the preceding work, the MWTI alters final wellbore temperatures as well as formation temperatures in the interwell zone and also farther out from the well template. The multiwell thermal model is shown to converge closely in very characteristic fashion to two different logged and measured temperature profiles at a vertical depth range of more than 3,000 ft.
            The empirical data, including field history, represent a unique opportunity to study and understand this important topic. Before this current work, the authors’ experience found the industry discussion of the MWTI or "cross heating" to be largely anecdotal. Model validation against field data is necessary to achieve a full understanding of the physical system and to provide confidence in the predictive capability.
            The modeling of wellbore and formation temperatures for closely spaced wells has not been widely examined in the industry literature, as observed by Bellarby (2009). The current work presents an improved methodology on the basis of standard-industry techniques. The method uses standard industry thermal/hydraulic modeling software for a single well and a fully transient finite-difference model for the formation in a loosely coupled, iterative analysis. The iteration scheme is achieved by the coupling of the standard analytical solution for the isolated single-well temperature scenario with the solution in the formation for the cross-heating scenario.
            The effect of the MWTI is important for closely spaced wells such as offshore platforms or subsea and Arctic developments. The multiwell disturbance on formation and wellbore temperatures may affect well design, facilities planning, and operations. For example, given nominal flowing wellhead temperatures (FWHTs) approaching 350°F for HP/HT platform developments, even small temperature increases may have a critical impact on the design and layout of surface receiving systems. Annular-pressure buildup (APB), wellhead movement, tubular-stress design, cement-slurry design, subsidence/compaction effects, and facilities health and safety issues can all be affected. If the MWTI is not taken into account, then load events such as APB, wellhead movement, and thermally induced stresses may be underestimated. Concurrent and batch-drilling operations, including cementation, will also be affected.},

	abstract = {The present study was carried out to estimate variance components for growth traits in Naeini goats. Bodyweight records were collected for two flocks under supervision of the Agriculture Organisation of the Esfahan province between 2000 and 2007. Investigated traits were birthweight (BW; n = 2483), weaning weight (WW; n = 1211) and average daily gain from birth to weaning (ADG; n = 1211). Environmental effects were investigated using fixed-effect models, while (co)variance components and genetic parameters were estimated with single- and three-trait analyses using REML methods and WOMBAT software. Six different animal models were fitted to the traits, with the best model for each trait determined by log-likelihood ratio tests (LRT). All traits were significantly influenced by herd, birth year, sex of the kid, birth type and dam age (P {\textless} 0.01). On the basis of LRT, maternal permanent environmental effects (c2) were significant for WW and ADG, while BW was affected only by direct genetic effects. Direct heritability estimates for BW, WW and ADG were 0.25 ± 0.05, 0.07 ± 0.06 and 0.21 ± 0.11, respectively. The estimate of c2 was 0.16 ± 0.06 for both WW and ADG. Estimates of genetic correlation for BW–ADG, BW–WW and ADG–WW were 0.49, 0.61 and 0.94, respectively. The estimated phenotypic correlations were positive and were between 0.03 (BW–ADG) and 0.95 (ADG–WW). These results indicate that selection can be used to improve growth traits in this goat breed.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, process mining emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis of processes using event data. Classical data mining techniques such as classification, clustering, regression, association rule learning, and sequence/episode mining do not focus on business process models and are often only used to analyze a specific step in the overall process. Process mining focuses on end-to-end processes and is possible because of the growing availability of event data and new process discovery and conformance checking techniques.
            
              Process models are used for
              analysis
              (e.g., simulation and verification) and
              enactment
              by BPM/WFM systems. Previously, process models were typically made by hand without using event data. However, activities executed by people, machines, and software leave trails in so-called
              event logs
              . Process mining techniques use such logs to discover, analyze, and improve business processes.
            
            Recently, the Task Force on Process Mining released the Process Mining Manifesto. This manifesto is supported by 53 organizations and 77 process mining experts contributed to it. The active involvement of end-users, tool vendors, consultants, analysts, and researchers illustrates the growing significance of process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The practical relevance of process mining and the interesting scientific challenges make process mining one of the “hot” topics in Business Process Management (BPM). This article introduces process mining as a new research field and summarizes the guiding principles and challenges described in the manifesto.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Seed germination experiments are conducted in a wide variety of biological disciplines. Numerous methods of analysing the resulting data have been proposed, most of which fall into three classes: intuition-based germination indexes, classical non-linear regression analysis and time-to-event analysis (also known as survival analysis, failure-time analysis and reliability analysis). This paper briefly reviews all three of these classes, and argues that time-to-event analysis has important advantages over the other methods but has been underutilized to date. It also reviews in detail the types of time-to-event analysis that are most useful in analysing seed germination data with standard statistical software. These include non-parametric methods (life-table and Kaplan–Meier estimators, and various methods for comparing two or more groups of seeds) and semi-parametric methods (Cox proportional hazards model, which permits inclusion of categorical and quantitative covariates, and fixed and random effects). Each method is illustrated by applying it to a set of real germination data. Sample code for conducting these analyses with two standard statistical programs is also provided in the supplementary material available online (at
              http://journals.cambridge.org/
              ). The methods of time-to-event analysis reviewed here can be applied to many other types of biological data, such as seedling emergence times, flowering times, development times for eggs or embryos, and organism lifetimes.},

In contrast to replaying execution on uniprocessors, deterministic replay on multiprocessors is very challenging to implement efficiently because of the need to reproduce the order of or the values read by shared memory operations performed by multiple threads. In this paper, we present DoublePlay, a new way to efficiently guarantee replay on commodity multiprocessors. Our key insight is that one can use the simpler and faster mechanisms of single-processor record and replay, yet still achieve the scalability offered by multiple cores, by using an additional execution to parallelize the record and replay of an application. DoublePlay timeslices multiple threads on a single processor, then runs multiple time intervals (
              epochs
              ) of the program concurrently on separate processors. This strategy, which we call
              uniparallelism
              , makes logging much easier because each epoch runs on a single processor (so threads in an epoch never simultaneously access the same memory) and different epochs operate on different copies of the memory. Thus, rather than logging the order of shared-memory accesses, we need only log the order in which threads in an epoch are timesliced on the processor. DoublePlay runs an additional execution of the program on multiple processors to generate checkpoints so that epochs run in parallel. We evaluate DoublePlay on a variety of client, server, and scientific parallel benchmarks; with spare cores, DoublePlay reduces logging overhead to an average of 15\% with two worker threads and 28\% with four threads.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing offers significant advantages to Internet users by deploying hosted services via bespoke service-provisioning environments. In advance, the emergence of Inter-Cloud increases the competences and opportunities of clients for a wider resource provision selection. This extends current capabilities by decoupling users from cloud providers while at the same time cloud providers offer an augmented service delivery mean. In practice, cloud users make use of their brokering component for selecting the best available resource, in terms of computational power and software licensing of a datacenter based on service level agreements for service execution. However, from the cloud perspective, the overall choice for balancing the different workloads within the Inter-Cloud is a complex decision. This article explores the performance of an Inter-Cloud to measure the utilization levels among their sub-clouds for various job submissions. With this in mind, the solution is modeled for achieving load balancing based on historical records from past service execution experiences. The record files are composed in the form of log files that keep related information about the size of the Inter-Cloud, basic specifications, and job submission parameters. Finally, the solution is integrated in a simulated setting for exploring the performance of the approach for various heavy workload submissions.},

	abstract = {A pre- and post-processing weather radar data module was developed in the Matlab suite of software with GIS data exchange abilities for storm event analysis. During pre-processing, each radar sweep is converted from spherical to Cartesian coordinates in the desired temporal and spatial resolution. The module's functionality in post processing includes radar data display, geo-referencing over GIS maps, data filtering with the Wiener filter and single or multiple sweep processing. The user can perform individual storm cell detection and tracking, resulting in the storm's average velocity and track length. The tested methods are modifications of the LoG (Laplacian of the Gaussian) blob detection method and a Brownian particle trajectory linking algorithm. Radar reflectivity factor (Z) data can be referenced over predefined rainfall (R) gauges in order to determine the radar Z–R equation parameters. The user can also produce spatially distributed precipitation estimates by using standard Z–R equations from the literature. The module's functionality is demonstrated using data from a rainfall event captured by the NSA Souda Bay C-Band radar during a storm in October 2006. Results show that the Rosenfeld Tropical Z–R equation is the one that gives a satisfactory description of the spatial and temporal precipitation distribution of the investigated event.},

	abstract = {Summary
            Background: In this paper, we describe a new method for the study of clinical information system (CIS) logfiles joined with information in the clinical data warehouse. This method uses heatmap representations and clustering techniques to examine clinicians’ viewing patterns of laboratory test results. The context of our application of these techniques is to inform the creation of a widget-based interface to the CIS.
            Objectives: We address the rationale, feasibility, and usefulness of our method through examination of three hypotheses:
            1) The frequency distribution of laboratory test viewing will follow a ’long tail’ pattern, indicating that patterns are highly variable and supporting the rationale for a widget-based configurable system.
            2) Patterns of laboratory testing viewing (by clinician, specialty, clinician/patient/day, and ICD-9-CM codes) can be distinguished by our methods.
            3) The identified clusters will include more than 80\% of the laboratory test elements found in 30 randomly selected patient records for one day.
            Methods: The data were plotted as heatmaps and clustered using hierarchical clustering software. Various parameters were tested to give the optimal clusters.
            Results: All the hypotheses were supported. For Hypothesis 3, 91.4\% of information elements in the records were covered by the generated clusters.
            Conclusions: Study findings support the rationale, feasibility, and usefulness of our methods to examine patterns of information access among clinicians and to inform the creation of widget-based interfaces. The results also contribute to our general understanding of clinicians’ CIS use.},

	abstract = {This study is an examination of the effect of agent-based autonomous production scheduling, using the virtual factory on multi-agent simulation system. In the autonomous manufacturing system, a production plan is generated autonomously and dynamically, using communication and negotiation between agents that correspond to factory components. As infrastructure software for agent based manufacturing, the artisoc(c) is used as multi-agent simulator system. In this virtual factory, three types of agents are equipped. Users can operate a configuration such as input new jobs, adjusting a machine setting, etc, with monitoring conditions of agents. Additionally, this simulator has capability of input and output files such as assembly process schedules and logs of practical operations. As a result, by adjustment of the agent’s behavior with factory floor detail, the assembly schedule becomes more effective. The experiment was carried out to show that local negotiations contribute to global optimization when resources in the factory are effectively distributed and shared.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Successful underbalanced drilling (UBD) operations are strongly dependant on the understanding of in-situ stress condition in addition to rock mechanical properties. Wellbore integrity, which plays an imperative role in all the oil and gas operations, requires accurate geomechanical modeling and wellbore stability analysis. Borehole failure problems, which are very likly specially when drilling underbalanced, cost the petroleum industry several billions of dollars each year. Prevention of these problems requires clear understanding of the interaction between formation strength, in-situ stresses and drilling practice. Since in-situ stress and rock strength are not controllable parameters, adjusting the drilling practices, i.e. selecting optimal trajectory and bottom-hole pressure, is the common way to inhibit wellbore failure, which can be achieved by performing specialized geomechanical studies.
            Drilling through some challenging formations in Kurdistan, has been always associated with several wellbore stability problems such as mud losses, borehole washout, stuck pipe, extra cutting/caving, and tight holes, which caused numerous nonproductive time to the drilling program and required drilling sidetracks in some of the wells. Review of the drilling reports and dual-caliper logs from 11 offset wells in the area revealed a huge amount of washouts in these formations. These events put a question mark on the feasibility of UBD in these intervals and required conducting a geomechanical modeling and wellbore stability study.
            In this study, data from offset wells was analyzed to estimate the local in-situ stress magnitudes and orientations, in addition to pore pressure. The mechanical properties of the formations were evaluated using sonic, density, and gamma ray logs. A rock mechanical properties database and data management software was applied to correlate the calculated dynamic elastic properties to the most appropriate static stiffness parameters for a base case wellbore stability model and subsequent sensitivity analyses. 2D elastoplastic and 3D linear elastic models were used to back-analyze the borehole failures in the selected offset wells to verify and calibrate the geomechanical model.
            Finally, an operating mud weight window was defined, and the optimum profile of the mud weight was recommended for drilling through each formations. This study showed that underbalanced drilling is feasible through the carbonate intervals, however, will encouter severe wellbore stability problems in the shaly and silty formations.},

	abstract = {The Risk Based Maintenance (RBM) procedure was applied to steam turbine casing as a typical example of components suffering from combined damage modes such as creep-fatigue cracking. Risk analysis was conducted through the field inspection database for cracks at the portion under creep-fatigue conditions. The primary stage of RBM is semi-quantitative risk analysis for risk prioritization of events using risk matrixes coupled with parts breakdown trees and event trees. The secondary stage is quantitative probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) to optimize maintenance intervals for the prioritized issues. The unreliability functions were expressed in two-dimensional log-normal type probability functions of operation time and start-up cycles. As the field data include censored or sustained ones, the precise correlation factors are not always obtained from the data sets. To estimate the most likely correlation factor, the Bayesian inference was introduced to the analysis of two-dimensional probability functions. The risk functions of operation periods were obtained using the assumed operation pattern, that is, the ratio of start-up cycles to operation time by substituting this relation into the two-dimensional probability distribution functions. Total expected cost function was defined as the sum of periodical repair cost rate and the total risk cost of subject event and component. The cost function has usually the optimum cost point and it can be used as the basis of the decision making of maintenance intervals.},

            We have developed a technique in which we use a borehole video camera and post-processing software to make a record of the optical brightness as a function of depth in polar firn. We call this method borehole optical stratigraphy. To measure firn compaction, we note the positions of optical features on the borehole wall detected by an initial ‘baseline’ log. We track the displacements of these features in subsequent logs. The result provides a measurement of the relative vertical motion and thus compaction of the firn over the survey period. We have successfully used this system at Summit, Greenland, to measure the depth distribution of firn column shortening experienced in a borehole over three 1 year periods. The uppermost 30 m of the firn at Summit is compacting as predicted by a simple steady-state model, implying that the firn density profile at Summit is at or close to steady state over the past ∼70 years.},

	abstract = {Despite advances in the application of automated statistical and machine learning techniques to system log and trace data there will always be a need for human analysis of machine traces, because trace information on unstable systems may be incomplete, or incorrect. In addition, false positives from automated analysis will not likely disappear, and remediation measures and candidate fix tests will need to be evaluated. We present Zinsight, a visual and analytic tool that supports performance analysts and debugging, using large event traces to understand complex systems. This tool enables analysts to quickly create and manipulate high-level structural representations linked with statistical analysis derived from the underlying event trace data. The original raw trace is annotated with module names and a domain specific database is incorporated to relate software functions to module names. Navigable sequence context graph views present automatically extracted execution flow patterns from arbitrarily definable sets of events and are linked to frequency, distribution, and response time views. The goal is to reduce the cognitive and computational load on the analyst while providing answers to the most natural questions in a problem determination session. We present a case study of the tool in use on field problems from the recently shipped (late 2008) IBM z10 mainframe. As a result of the industry trend toward higher parallelism and memory latency, many issues were encountered with legacy code. The tool was applied successfully to diagnose these problems.},

	abstract = {The precise classification of changes in rock boundaries/facies from well-log records is a complex problem in geophysical data processing. Observed well-log data are a complex superposition of nonstationary/nonlinear signals of varying wavelengths and frequencies, shaped by the heterogeneous composition and structural variation of rock types in the earth. This impairs our ability to use traditional statistical techniques, which in most cases fail to discriminate and/or, at best, do not precisely extract facies changes from complex well-log signals. We propose a new method, set in a Bayesian neural network (BNN) framework and using a powerful hybrid Monte Carlo simulation scheme to identify facies changes from complex well-log data. We first construct a complex, composite, synthetic time series using the data from three simple models: first-order autoregressive, logistic, and random white noise. Then we attempt to identify individualsignals in the pooled synthetic time series. We use the autocorrelation and the spectral characteristics of the individual signals as input vectors for training, validating, and testing the artificial neural network model. The results show that the Bayesian separation scheme provides consistently good results, with accuracy at more than 74\%. When the method was tested using well-log data from the German Continental Deep Drilling Program (KTB), it was able to discriminate boundaries of lithofacies with an accuracy of approximately 92\% in validation and 93\% in test samples. The efficacy of the BNN in the presence of colored noise suggests that the designed network topology is robust for up to 30\% correlated noise; however, adding more noise (say, 50\% or more) obscures the desired signals. Our method provides a robust means for decoding finely detailed successions of lithofacies from complex well-log data, better describing the nature of the underlying inhomogeneous crust.},

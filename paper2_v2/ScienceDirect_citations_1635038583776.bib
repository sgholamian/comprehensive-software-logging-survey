abstract = {Research Objectives
To study the effect of a wearable, powered exoskeleton orthosis controlled by a brain-computer interface (BCI) on upper extremity function in a single participant with moderate to severe hemiparesis.
Design
Single subject design with pretest, mid, and posttest.
Setting
Home and outpatient.
Participants
Participant was a 41-year old right-hand-dominant male with moderate to severe (Fugl-meyer upper extremity [FM-UE] 33/66) left-sided hemiparesis due to a stroke that occurred 18 months prior, with left homonymous hemianopsia, left hemi-neglect, left central VII nerve palsy, and spasticity in the weakened left upper extremity. The stroke lesioned the right lentiform nucleus and adjacent white matter.
Interventions
Brain implants were surgically placed within the right precentral gyrus region of the cortex, representing the left hand. The 12-week intervention consisted of neuromotor prosthesis training with BCI controlling the powered exoskeleton and biofeedback for controlling a game cursor; physical therapy once/week; occupational therapy twice/week.
Main Outcome Measures
Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), FM-UE, Motor Activity Log (MAL) domains of Amount of Use (AOU) and Quality of Movement (QOM)
Results
ARAT scores with the powered exoskeleton were greater with BCI (change: 10-point, 18%) than with myoelectric control (change: 5-points, 9%). Upper extremity outcomes exceeded the minimal clinically important difference thresholds for FM-UE (change: 8-point, 21%), MAL-AOU (change: 18.5-points, 12%), and MAL-QOM (Change: 17-point, 11%).
Conclusions
The results indicate promising outcomes of the neuromotor prosthesis on upper extremity function for a single participant with potential for future research with implanted systems combined with therapy.

abstract = {Background
Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19-9) has been reported as the most significant survival predictor of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the elevation of CA19-9 could interfere with obstructive jaundice and the predictive value of CA19-9 in PDAC patients with jaundice remains to be analyzed and elucidated to find possible adjustments.
Objective
To evaluate the predictability of preoperative CA19-9 and its adjustments for the overall survival (OS) of PDAC patients by analyzing the relationship between preoperative serum CA19-9 and total bilirubin (TBIL).
Methods
A total of 563 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma in our center between January 2015 and September 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinicopathologic information was collected and preoperative parameters such as CA19-9, CEA, TBIL, γ-GGT, AST, ALT, and ALP were recorded as well as overall survival rates, which began from the date of operation to that of death or the last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier survival curves with log-rank test and Cox regression models were applied using SPSS and the survival and survminer packages in R software.
Results
Using 39/390/1000 as the cut-off values for preoperative serum CA19-9, significant capability of OS stratification was found in the total cohort (p < 0.001, MST = 29.7/19.1/15.2/12.1 months) and patients with TBIL <102.6 μmol/L (p < 0.001, MST = 32.2/19.6/15.0/11.2 months). However, in the subgroup of TBIL≥102.6 μmol/L, this classification method was replaced by the combined scoring of CA19-9/AST and CA19-9/γ-GGT.
Conclusions
As an independent predictor of overall survival of PDAC patients, preoperative serum CA19-9 is defective in survival stratification when TBIL≥102.6 μmol/L but a positive survival prognosis could be achieved with the application of combined preoperative CA19-9/AST and CA19-9/γ-GGT.}

In recent years, they become more difficult due to the increased complexity of hardware and software. Hence, an important point is to collect representative signal samples and reveal characteristic features allowing to evaluate device operational profiles. This results in the need of an efficient time series analysis. This problem is considered in relevance to embedded systems and Internet of Things devices. The paper presents a new scheme of decomposing time series by introducing higher level objects targeted at the searched system properties. They create a compact state model which facilitates deriving knowledge on system behaviour to validate correctness of its operation. The collected samples are aggregated into objects according to predefined similarity metrics, these objects can be traced, correlated, and merged with relevant operational log events. For this purpose, a set of original algorithms have been composed and included in the developed software tool. The presented approach has been evaluated on a representative dataset obtained from commercial Holter devices and was used to explore their energy consumption efficiency.}

Introducción y objetivos
El análisis de la deformación miocárdica puede aportar información adicional a la fracción de eyección del ventrículo izquierdo (FEVI) en la miocardiopatía dilatada no isquémica (MDNI). El objetivo es analizar la factibilidad del estudio del strain del ventrículo izquierdo mediante feature tracking (FT) de cardiorresonancia magnética en la MDNI y determinar su relevancia clínica y pronóstica.
Métodos
Se incluyó retrospectivamente a los pacientes consecutivos con MDNI sometidos a cardiorresonancia magnética. Se obtuvieron el strain global longitudinal, circunferencial y radial del ventrículo izquierdo de secuencias convencionales de cine mediante un software de análisis de FT. Se evaluó su asociación con el evento combinado (insuficiencia cardiaca, implante de desfibrilador en prevención secundaria y muerte).
Resultados
Se pudo realizar el FT en los 98 pacientes evaluados (edad, 68± 13 años; el 72% varones). La concordancia intraobservador e interobservadores fue buena para el strain global longitudinal y circunferencial, y más limitada para el radial. El strain global circunferencial se asoció de manera independiente (OR=1,16; p=0,045) con la normalización de la FEVI en el seguimiento y fue el único parámetro morfológico con asociación independiente (OR=1,15; p=0,038) con el evento combinado. Un valor <–8,2% fue capaz de predecir la aparición de este evento en el seguimiento (Log-rank test, 4,6; p=0,032)
Conclusiones
El análisis del strain del ventrículo izquierdo mediante FT es factible y reproducible en MDNI. El strain global circunferencial fue capaz de predecir la recuperación de la FEVI y la aparición de eventos cardiovasculares mayores en el seguimiento.
Introduction and objectives
Myocardial strain analysis could provide additional information to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDC). Our aim was to analyze the feasibility of left ventricular strain evaluation using cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking (FT) in NIDC, and to determine its clinical and prognostic impact.
Methods
We retrospectively included consecutive patients with NIDC who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance. Left ventricular global longitudinal, circumferential and radial strain were obtained from standard cine sequences using FT analysis software. We evaluated their association with a composite endpoint (heart failure, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in secondary prevention, or death).
Results
FT analysis could be performed in all of the 98 patients (mean age 68±13 years, 72% men). Intra- and interobserver concordance was good for global longitudinal and circumferential strain but was worse for radial strain. Global circumferential strain was independently associated (OR, 1.16; P=.045) with LVEF normalization during follow-up and was the only morphological parameter independently associated with the composite endpoint (OR, 1.15; P=.038). A cutoff value <−8.2% was able to predict the incidence of this event during follow-up (log-rank 4.6; P=.032).
Conclusions
Left ventricular strain analysis with FT is feasible and reproducible in NIDC. Global circumferential strain was able to predict LVEF recovery and the appearance of major cardiovascular events during follow-up. Full English text available from:www.revespcardiol.org/en}

During these busy times, Developing and updating technologies is itself a big challenge. If any bugs occur in future or to keep track of features are added are working properly according to requirements, it needs some tools to keep track of it. For these things to happen, it requires some methodology to improve debug time like ETL (Event Trace Log) for multiple display features. The other things are that, code that is written today has to be written in such a way that it could be used for at least next 10 years. This will reduce the time of adding the same code simultaneously. Collecting the ETL in the encoded form helps in securing the sensitive information present in the trace log. Adding more testing codes in Unit Test Framework (UTF) find more bugs at early stages which will reduce the code cost. Adding MMIO (Memory Mapped I/O) verifier rules as the part of UTF helps in register verification (Simulates real Hardware context). Addition of MMIO rules for existing and new display features in separate xml file for different platforms makes it easy to identify in which platform feature failure in happening. All these methods help in code quality improvements for Intel Windows Graphics Driver.}

We describe a model of multi-institutional, multisociety, online case conferences that is a case-based group discussion of selected (nonrandom) cases which are subsequently hosted on social media and online platforms (e.g., YouTube, websites) to be available for a wider audience.
Materials and Methods
Using online conferencing software (Zoom, GoToMeeting), participants from both abdominal and cardiothoracic radiologists engage in separate, subspecialty one-hour meetings discussing a variety of meaningful cases. Participants take turns presenting their cases to the group and discuss significant findings, interpretations, differential diagnoses, and any other teaching points. All of the case conferences for both societies are recorded and edited to be uploaded on YouTube and their respective websites.
Results
Participants from these conferences log in from 14 institutions in 7 states across the United States. The YouTube videos reach thousands of people around the world. The abdominal case conference on YouTube has received almost 1,300 views with 90 videos uploaded. The thoracic (the Society of Thoracic Radiology) case conference has been running for over 7 years, with 226 videos uploaded to YouTube and 38,200 views, 1426 subscribers, and a total watch time of over 525,800 minutes. Twitter has been utilized by both groups to promote online viewership.
Conclusion
Our model is feasible and effective compared to traditional peer review. The cases selected are deliberate and focused on quality improvement and/or education. We harness online engagement, specifically social media presence, which has opened new opportunities to educate our peers and reach a global audience, including the nonradiologic community, to learn about radiology and unique practices.}

This research develops an integrated general purpose data collection module that time stamps detector and phase state changes within a National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) actuated traffic signal controller to provide recommendations for the flashing yellow arrow left-turn mode on a cycle-by-cycle basis. 115 left-turn approaches at 38 intersections with locations across the State of Florida were analyzed totaling 1370 h of video data processed including off-peak and peak conditions. Video data extraction was an essential step in developing the gap thresholds for the permissive left-turn. Actual intersection field data were obtained through loop detector mapping to the controller in the lab in real-time mode using a peer-to-peer logic environment. A custom communications software was developed to retrieve instantaneous channel input data, synchronize opposing through green phase, analyze traffic information, provide the algorithm decision, and generate a real-time log recording the events to determine whether it would be optimal to switch the red arrow to a flashing yellow arrow. The algorithm determines the time interval between the successive arrivals of vehicles and computes the corresponding headway for each lane by cycle on a second-by-second basis. Peer-to-peer logic is a necessary step to verify and validate new traffic concepts prior to field-testing and offers the advantage of acquiring and analyzing real-time traffic data coupled with video feed with the benefit of a safe environment.}

abstract = {Summary
Introduction
Retention of indwelling ureteral stents due to loss to follow-up can result in significant harm to patients, often requiring multiple trips to the operating room. Despite widespread use of electronic medical records, there are few standardized options for urologists to track ureteral stents and no data on the rate of retained stents in a pediatric population.
Objective
This pilot quality improvement project aims to: 1) develop a simple process to track indwelling ureteral stents using the Epic electronic medical record and 2) determine the incidence of forgotten stents in a pediatric population.
Methods
We identified that operating room staff scan a barcode for ureteral stents at the time of surgery to log the stent as "Implanted" in the patient's medical record. The stent can later be marked as "Explanted" at the time of removal. A report was designed within Epic to identify all patients with a ureteral stent implanted from April 2014 to June 2019 at our hospital. We reviewed the records of patients whose stents had never been marked as "Explanted" to determine if any had a retained stent. A workflow was then designed to ensure staff would mark stents as "Explanted" at the time of removal and to periodically run the report within Epic to ensure that all patients with ureteral stents in place have appropriate follow-up.
Results
Our report identified 152 ureteral stents with a status of "Implanted". 3 patients did not have evidence of stent removal documented in their medical record. Follow up with these patients revealed stent removal at an outside location.
Discussion
Current approaches to stent tracking are laborious with limitations to adherence. The Epic software directly incorporates stent tracking into the individual patient chart allowing for easy implementation and follow up. Our study revealed no retained stents in our pediatric population.
Conclusions
All patients with ureteral stents placed at a single institution over a 5-year period were easily identified using an automated Epic report. Through this report, we will prevent morbidity associated with stent retention. This technique could easily be implemented at other hospital systems that use Epic, and similar reporting tools could be designed within other electronic medical record systems. The incidence of ureteral stent retention in the pediatric population is likely significantly lower than for their adult counterparts.}

We achieve a detection accuracy of 95.98% on the full NSL-KDD dataset and 87.74% on the selected sub-features of the dataset. Detection of anomalous traffic and network intrusion is done during the PACKET_IN event at the controller and then again by fetching the flow statistics from the OpenFlow switches at regular intervals. Selective logging of suspicious packets/flows during a PACKET_IN event enables an IP traceback to be performed in the eventuality of an attack which can be initiated by a network admin using an HTTP-based web console. This approach gains significance given that it is practically impossible to achieve 100% attack detection accuracy. Moreover, it is not always correct to take punitive action against packets of a traffic flow, solely based on a detection of a possible threat which may result in blocking or dropping of genuine packets. In the proposed scheme, logging is performed selectively at the controller and not at the switches, achieving significant savings in terms of overall memory resources. Moreover logging is performed using the in-memory structure at the controller thereby enhances the performance of the logging operation over traditional file-based database by 9.76%. Finally, we have chosen this approach because (i) SDN provides a centralized architecture for detection analysis and logging (ii) SVM provides decent detection accuracy without much computation overhead (iii) Selective Logging provides about 90% to 95% savings in terms of overall memory resources and (iv) IP traceback provides the ability to track the actual source of the packets in the eventuality of an attack.}

Total readings of 50,000 entries from each sensor was recorded every 3 min by a home-designed microprocessor-based logging system for three months of June, July, and August 2019.

Histograms and a probability density function (PDF) of temperature and humidity are built by a representative rational function as a model of main climate parameters variations. By examining min-mean-max values of data, it is observed that the office with window films has increased indoor humidity and, in most instances, reduced temperature by 2–5 °C compared to double-glazed bare windows which can significantly reduce cooling loads in extreme hot-arid climates. Simulation results are presented on the energy saved and the reduced CO2 footprints by applying the solar window films in the ACK building.}

The pedigree file comprised 36,640 animals, including 3677 sires and 24,472 cows. Genetic parameters were obtained by single-trait analysis using the AIREMLF90 software. Heritability estimates of 305MY and of 305MY fitted to the different non-linear models were higher in the first lactation and ranged from 0.10 to 0.29. We observed a greater heterosis effect for 305MY (and 305MY fitted) verified in cows of genetic group 1/2H, which presented average production superior to the average of their parents (of pure breeds) in the first (1034.33 kg) and second (1303.94 kg) lactation, respectively. Both Wood's and Wilmink's models stood out in quality of fit, presenting the best estimates for 305MY adjusted for different lactation orders. Wood's model is the most suitable to estimate 305MY of cows with a higher proportion of H genes. However, Wilmink's model allows estimating heterosis effects for 305MY and components of the lactation curve more similar to those observed in 305MY in the different genetic groups. The results indicate that local breeders can promote an improvement in milk production through exploitation of the heterosis effect, making choices of genetic combinations (breeders) more suitable for mating to obtain greater economic and productive efficiency of their herds during lactations.}

abstract = {Background
A distressing issue of diabetic ulcer (DU) is its poor healing feature with limited clinical solutions. We have previously shown that 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) is a promising alternative to the currently limited measures for DU. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation has been believed to impose certain therapeutic effect on restoration of injury. Thus, this study aims to explore whether the combination of MSCs and ALA-PDT will exert a more advanced curative effect on DU.
Methods
Diabetic mice were induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg/d) for consecutive 5 days. A full-thickness skin injury (diameter 6 mm) was created in the center of the back of each mouse, and then 10 μl of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) suspension was added to establish an infected DU model. All DU models were randomly divided into four groups: Untreated group, MSCs group, ALA-PDT group, and ALA-PDT combined with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) (ALA-PDT + MSCs) group. The wound sizes were recorded by a digital camera, and the healing rates were calculated using Image J software. Bacterial loads on wounds were measured using CFU (Colony forming units) analysis. The epithelialization, inflammatory cells infiltration and granulation tissue formation were monitored by Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and the corresponding semi-quantitative score was matched. Growth and pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Results
Either ALA-PDT or injection of hUC-MSCs resulted in a rapid wound closure compared with the untreated, while their combination brought about the most prominent healing. On day 12, healing rates of the untreated, MSCs, ALA-PDT and ALA-PDT + MSCs were 40.56% ± 7.06%, 74.23 ± 4.83%, 84.03 ± 3.53%, 99.67 ± 0.49%, respectively. The bacterial burden reductions were approximately 1.58 logs (97.36%, P < 0.05), 2.34 logs (99.54%, P < 0.01), 4.50 logs (nearly 100%, P < 0.001) for MSCs, ALA-PDT and ALA-PDT + MSCs, respectively. Histology revealed reduced inflammatory cells and improved collagen precipitation and angiogenesis after hUC-MSCs and ALA-PDT treatment compared to the untreated. The combined therapy leaded to a more intact epithelium, similar to the healthy. Finally, ELISA revealed that the property of ALA-PDT to stimulate transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inhibit IL (interleukin) -1β and IL-6 outweighed that of hUC-MSCs, and this function of the combination overwhelmed that of any single therapy.
Conclusions
Our findings indicated that the strategy of combining ALA-PDT with hUC-MSCs possessed a significantly enhanced therapeutic effect over either single therapy, providing a promising innovative therapeutic candidate for refractory wounds.}

abstract = {Purpose
To use electronic health record (EHR) time logs to calculate the complete cost profiles of routine pars plana vitrectomy surgery.
Design
Economic analysis.
Participants
Patients undergoing elective vitrectomy procedures (Current Procedural Terminology codes 67040, 67041, and 67042) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in fiscal year 2019.
Methods
Process flow mapping for routine vitrectomy surgery was used to define the operative episode. De-identified time logs were sourced from an internal perioperative data warehouse to calculate procedure-level durations. The costs of materials and overhead were calculated from internal financial management software. Costs per minute for space, equipment, and personnel were based on internal figures. These inputs were used for a time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) analysis.
Main Outcome Measures
Complete cost profile of routine pars plana vitrectomy surgery.
Results
Cost analysis of routine vitrectomy surgery resulted in a total cost of $7169.79 per patient, which was $2053.85 more than the maximum Medicare reimbursement for the equivalent episode, $5115.93. Vitrectomy cases do not break even unless the case duration is fewer than 26.81 minutes, overhead is reduced by 53.78%, or reimbursement is increased by 40.15%. Reimbursement does not compensate for variable costs alone for cases lasting longer than 55.09 minutes. In the cohort used here, 68% of cases are completely unprofitable, with increasing losses directly proportional to the length of the case.
Conclusions
This analysis showed that true costs for routine vitrectomy procedures are significantly more than the maximum allowable Medicare reimbursement. Academic ophthalmology departments may benefit from more accurate costing approaches using existing EHR data. These approaches may be informative for policy discussion regarding appropriate reimbursement.}

abstract = {Introduction
Separated endodontic instruments may adversely affect the outcome of endodontic treatment. The combination of ultrasonic techniques and dental operating microscopes appears to be effective in the removal of separated instruments compared with more randomized techniques. This study evaluated the roles of root canal curvature and separated instrument length on the time needed to loosen and retrieve the instrument fragments.
Methods
The retrieval procedures of 128 separated instruments referred to a private endodontic practice for retreatment by general practitioners were evaluated in patients who were monitored for a minimum of 6 months. Preoperative cone-beam computed tomographic images were used to measure separated instrument lengths in relation to the degrees of canal curvatures. Ultrasonic instruments were used in the initial phase to remove the tooth structure and to loosen the fractured instrument. In the second phase, ultrasonic instruments, wire loops, or XP Shapers (FKG Dentaire SA, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland) were used for fragment removal. The time periods for all procedures were recorded. Statistical analysis was completed applying log-normal regression, structural equation modeling, and linear regression using Stata Version 14.2 software (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX).
Results
All separated instruments were successfully retrieved. Using the protocol in this study, 89.8% of the instruments were removed using ultrasonic instruments alone with a mean time of 221 seconds. The instrument removal time was dependent on both the instrument length and the root canal curvature. Additionally, preparation times were proportionately longer with increasing separated instrument lengths when the loop device was required.
Conclusions
The preparation phase appears to have an important role in the retrieval of separated instruments. Preparation times for both non-loop and loop groups demonstrate that length and curvature are independent predictors of the log-transformed time. Generally, procedure times were extended with increasing file lengths and higher degrees of canal curvature.}

abstract = {Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most documented arrhythmia in COVID-19 pneumonia. Left atrial (LA) strain analysis, assessing LA contractility have been associated with the development of new-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) in several clinical situations. We aimed to assess the diagnostic ability of LA strain parameters to predict NOAF in patients with severe hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia.
Method
We conducted a prospective single center study at Amiens Hospital University (NCT04354558). The population study was composed of adult patients with a severe or critical Covid-19 pneumonia in sinus rhythm at inclusion. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed within 48hours of admission. LA strain analysis was performed by an automated software. The following LA strain parameters were recorded: LA strain during reservoir phase (LASr), LA strain during conduit phase (LAScd) and LA strain during contraction phase (LASct). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of NOAF during the intensive care unit (ICU) stay.
Results
From March 2020 to February 2021, 79 patients were included. Sixteen patients (18%) developed NOAF in ICU. LAScd and LASr were significantly reduced in the NOAF group compared to the other group (8.1[6.3-10.9] vs. 17.2[5.0-10.2]%; P<0.001 and 20.2 [12.3-27.3] % vs. 30.5 [23.8-36.2] %; P=0.002 respectively). After adjustment, only LAScd remained independently predictive of NOAF (OR:2.43; 95%CI:1.18-3.37). A LAScd cut-off value of 11.1% had a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 75% to identify patients with NOAF. The 30-day cumulative risk of NOAF was 42±9% with LAScd <11% and 8±4% with LAScd >11% (log rank test P value<0.0001) (Fig. 1).
Conclusion
In patients with severe hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia, LAScd ≤11% at admission is a strong risk factor of NOAF development during critical care.}

SDN helps network engineers to monitor the network expeditely, control the network from a central point, identify malicious traffic and link failure in easy and efficient manner.

To mitigate this attack, the paper proposes to classify the benign traffic from DDoS attack traffic by using machine learning technique. The major contribution of this paper is identification of novel features for DDoS attack detections. Novel features are logged into CSV file to create the dataset and machine learning algorithms are trained on the created SDN dataset. Various work which has already been done for DDoS attack detection either used a non-SDN dataset or the research data is not made public. A novel hybrid machine learning model is utilized to perform the classification.

To characterize the variability in As sequestration in the sediments of a freshwater system in response to decadal- to centennial-scale climate oscillations, a freeze-core (CON01) was recovered from Control Lake, Northwest Territories. Radiocarbon dating of 13 bulk-organic samples provided temporal reference to core depth. Sediment geochemistry was determined using Itrax X-ray fluorescence core-scanning (Itrax-XRF). Elemental concentrations were measured on a sub-set of samples using ICP-MS after multi-acid (MA) digestion to assess the accuracy of Itrax-XRF results through a multivariate log-ratio (MLC) calibration. Comparison of Itrax-XRF to ICP-MS using the MLC in ItraXelerate software show Pearson's R2 values >0.75, with the exception of As (R2 = 0.44). MLC-calibrated Itrax-XRF elemental data were centered log-ratio (CLR) transformed to eliminate issues related to data closure. During the ca. 3300-yr sedimentary record, moderate-strength negative correlations between AsCLR and KCLR (Spearman's ρ = −0.38, p-value < 0.001, n = 785), and AsCLR and TiCLR, (Spearman's ρ = −0.52, p-value < 0.001, n = 785) suggest that As is primarily sequestered in sediments during intervals of warmer temperatures and higher productivity. Proxies for sediment particle size (TiCLR, KCLR) and As concentration (AsCLR) were examined for response to quasi-periodic climate oscillations using spectral analysis. Significant periodicities were observed with approximately 4–13, 30–60, 90–120, and 160–280 yr periods in TiCLR, KCLR, and AsCLR records. These frequencies are interpreted as corresponding to the North Atlantic Oscillation and/or 8–14-yr Schwabe sunspot cycles, 30–60-yr Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and centennial-scale solar cycles (e.g., 90-yr Gleissberg cycle; 205-yr Suess cycle). Coeval occurrence of these periodicities revealed through wavelet analysis of Control Lake geochemistry data suggests that these climate cycles only impact Control Lake when they occur concurrently.}

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s)
Nearly half of all patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) become refractory to standard-of-care anti-arrhythmic medications and catheter ablation. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as a well-tolerated and effective new treatment for VT. Since arrhythmogenic lesions are undetectable on CT scans, the practice of SBRT target volume delineation is not yet formalized. Many single-institution protocols involve only verbal discussion between electrophysiologists and radiation oncologists or manual re-orientation of surface renderings from electrophysiologic (EP) studies to correlate with the planes on CT scan. We present a novel software, "Rhythm-RT", that synthesizes data from EP studies and heart contours from radiation planning to automatically generate a preliminary target volume.
Materials/Methods
Along with DICOM files containing contours, Rhythm-RT can process electroanatomic mapping (EAM) data from CARTO (Biosense Webster, Irvine, CA) and EnSite Precision (Abbott, St. Paul, MN) as well as ablation navigation data from EnSite Precision. All input data are plotted in the reference coordinate system of the CT simulation scan. The user is able to translate and rotate imported EP spatial information for co-registration with contoured cardiac substructures. Rhythm-RT then identifies the cardiac substructure closest to the sites of low voltage from EAM or inadequate previous ablation on which to generate an SBRT gross target volume (GTV), adapted to the myocardial shape and transmural thickness of the cardiac substructure. The GTV is exported as a DICOM file which can be integrated with other contoured structures in the original radiation planning system.
Results
From October 2019 to February 2021, 7 males and 1 female with VT (53–84 years of age, ejection fraction 10–65%, and 0–7 previous catheter ablations) were treated using Rhythm-RT to guide cardiac SBRT planning. Compared to existing methods of delineating GTV crudely by free-hand, Rhythm-RT visualizes EP spatial information superimposed on heart contours. The area of myocardium selected as GTV, based on proximity to relevant EP signals, is computationally derived rather than inferred and liable to human error. Final GTV modification with the help of an experienced electrophysiologist is still recommended. When structural heart disease is multifocal, he/she may provide insight on which areas are more likely to cause arrhythmia. Adjustment of the GTV boundary may also be informed by direct observations during EP procedures that are not reflected in procedure equipment logs.
Conclusion
Rhythm-RT is a software that improves the accuracy and efficiency of target volume delineation in cardiac SBRT. Additional patient enrollment on our institutional protocol utilizing this technology is ongoing, along with outcomes analysis and expansion of input data versatility to include all EP and radiation planning systems.}

Given the high transactionality of today's software, logging effectiveness can be reduced by information overload.

As software evolves, however, levels of logs documenting surrounding feature implementations may also require modification as features once deemed important may have decreased in urgency and vice-versa. We present an automated approach that assists developers in evolving levels of such (feature) logs. The approach, based on mining Git histories and manipulating a degree of interest (DOI) model,1 transforms source code to revitalize feature log levels based on the “interestingness” of the surrounding code. Built upon JGit and Mylyn, the approach is implemented as an Eclipse IDE plug-in and evaluated on 18 Java projects with ∼3 million lines of code and ∼4K log statements. Our tool successfully analyzes 99.22% of logging statements, increases log level distributions by ∼20%, and increases the focus of logs in bug fix contexts ∼83% of the time. Moreover, pull (patch) requests were integrated into large and popular open-source projects.

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s)
There is limited data on the use of SBRT for salvage or consolidative treatment of Head and Neck cancers. Given the relatively poor prognosis for recurrent HN cancers and risk of toxicity with the addition of hypofractionated RT after conventional IMRT, we wanted to evaluate patients that should receive SBRT.
Materials/Methods
Patients with HN cancer treated in Radiation Medicine were selected and data collected using a data extraction software. This data extraction software collects data from electronic medical records at a large tertiary care academic medical center. Consecutively treated patients with adequate documentation were selected. Data gathered included primary sites of cancer, the initial total dose from conventional treatment, number of fractions, SBRT total dose and fractions, metastatic disease or locoregional progression, types of grade 3-5 toxicity (CTCAE v four toxicity), time to develop toxicity and progression and time since SBRT to last follow-up. Time to toxicity was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method, and each factor was compared using the log-rank test.
Results
Median age was 69 (Range 39-90). The median time between EBRT/ChemoRT and SBRT was six months (1-108 months). There were 59 males (71%) and 24 females (29%). The primary HN sites included oropharynx (OP) (37%), oral cavity (OC) (24%), hypopharynx, neck, salivary gland, paranasal sinus, and larynx cancers. The most common histology was squamous cell cancers, although less common histologies include salivary duct adenocarcinoma and esthesioneuroblastoma among others. Ten patients (12%) received SBRT after surgical resection of recurrence. Thirty-four patients (41%) were censored alive at < 12 months and had no observed toxicity up that time. Thirty-three of 83 (40%) of the patients overall developed grade 3 or four toxicity after SBRT, while 36 of 50 (72%) of patients with no toxicity developed progression or metastasis. Seventeen of 36 (47%) patients with follow-up > / = 12 months developed grade 3 or 4 toxicity while 16 of 47 (34%) developed grade 3/4 toxicity with follow-up < 12 months. Fifty-four of 83 (65%) patients had progressive or metastatic disease at the time of their last follow-up. Factors predicting worse toxicities were SBRT fractions (< 5 vs > 5, P = 0.0114), post-op SBRT (P = 0.0018) and the interval between EBRT/CRT and SBRT (P = 0.02). There was field overlap between EBRT and SBRT in all patients. Adverse outcomes include necrosis, fistula, stomal bleeding, seizure, intractable pain, and PEG dependence.
Conclusion
SBRT after full dose EBRT should be used in select patients given its toxicity and limited survival in patients with advanced/locally recurrent head and neck cancer. We are planning a prospective evaluation of the use of SBRT in recurrent/locally advanced settings.}

abstract = {Context:
Decision making by software systems that face uncertainty needs tracing to support understandability, as accountability is crucial. While logging has been essential to support explanations and understandability of behaviour, several issues still persist, such as the high cost for managing large logs, not knowing what to log, and the inability of logging techniques to relate events to each other or to specific occurrences of high-level activities in the system.
Objective:
Cronista is an alternative to logging for systems that act on top of runtime models. Instead of targeting the running systems, Cronista automatically collects the provenance of changes made to the runtime models, which aim at leveraging high-level representations, to produce more concise historical records. The provenance graphs capture causal links between those changes and the activities of the system, which are used to investigate issues.
Method:
Cronista’s architecture is described with the current design and the implementation of its high-level components for single-machine, multi-threaded systems. Cronista is applied to a traffic-simulation case study. The trade-offs of two different storage solutions are evaluated, i.e. the CDO model repositories, and JanusGraph graph databases.
Results:
Integrating Cronista into the case study requires only minor code changes. Cronista collected provenance graphs for the simulations as they ran, using both CDO and JanusGraph. Both solutions highlighted the cause of a seeded defect in the system. For the longer executions, both CDO and JanusGraph showed negligible overhead on the simulation times. Querying and visualisation tools were more user-friendly in JanusGraph than in CDO.
Conclusion:
Cronista demonstrates the feasibility of recording fine-grained provenance for the evolution of runtime models, while using it to investigate issues. User convenience and resource requirements need to be balanced. The paper present how the available technologies studied offer different trade-offs to satisfy the balance required.}

Right ventricular (RV) failure in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with unfavorable clinical events and a poor prognosis. Elevation of right atrial (RA) pressure is established as a marker for RV failure. However, the additive prognostic value of RA mechanical function is unclear.
Methods
The authors tested the hypothesis that RA function by strain echocardiography has prognostic usefulness by studying 165 consecutive patients with precapillary PH defined invasively: mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 25 mm Hg and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure < 15 mm Hg. Speckle-tracking strain analyses of the right atrium and right ventricle were performed, along with routine measures. Peak RA strain values from six segments using generic speckle-tracking software were averaged to RA peak longitudinal strain, representing RA global reservoir function. The primary end point was all-cause mortality during 5 years of follow-up. RA strain was similarly analyzed in a control group of 16 normal subjects for comparison.
Results
There were 151 patients with PH (mean age, 55 ± 16 years; 73% women; mean World Health Organization functional class, 2.6 ± 0.6), after 14 exclusions (three with atrial septal defects and 11 with left ventricular ejection fractions < 50%). RA strain measurement was feasible in 93% of patients and RV strain measurement in 88%. RA peak longitudinal strain was significantly reduced in patients with PH compared with control subjects, as expected (P < .001). During 5-year follow-up, 73 patients (48%) died. Patients with RA peak strain in the lowest quartile (<25%) had a significant risk for death (P = .006), even after correcting for confounding variables. RA strain was independently associated with survival in multivariate analysis (P = .039) and had additive prognostic value to RV strain (log-rank P = .01) in subgroup analysis.
Conclusions
RA peak longitudinal strain had additive prognostic usefulness to other clinical measures, including RV strain, RA area, and RA pressure, in patients with PH. RA mechanical function by strain imaging has potential for clinical applications in patients with PH.}

abstract = {Wearable IoT devices like fitness trackers and smartwatches continue to create opportunities and challenges for forensic investigators in the acquisition and analysis of evidential artefacts in scenarios where such devices are a witness to a crime. However, current commercial and traditional forensic tools available to forensic investigators fall short of conducting device extraction and analysis of forensic artefacts from many IoT devices due to their heterogeneous nature. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis and show artefacts of forensic value from the physical TomTom Spark 3 GPS fitness smartwatch, its companion app installed on an Android smartphone, and Bluetooth event logs located in the app’s metadata. Our forensic methodology and analysis involved the combination and use of a non-forensic tool, a commercial forensic tool, and a non-forensic manufacturer-independent analysis platform tool specifically designed for endurance athletes to identify, extract, analyse, and reconstruct user activity data in an investigative scenario. We show forensic metadata associated with the device information, past user activities, and audio files from the physical smartwatch. We recovered data associated with past user activities stored in proprietary activity files and databases maintained by the app on an Android smartphone. From the event logs, we show when user activity was synced with the app and uploaded to the device cloud storage. The results from our work provide vital references for forensic investigators to aid criminal investigations, highlight limitations of current forensic tools, and for developers of forensic tools an incentive into developing forensic software applications and tools that can decode all relevant data generated by wearable IoT devices.}

abstract = {Background
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is a well-established treatment modality for myelofibrosis (MF) and the only potentially curative treatment. However, adequate engraftment, relapse and transplant related mortality are big challenges in transplantation for this disease.
Objectives
Primary objective is to evaluate overall and disease-free survival of allogeneic HSCT for myelofibrosis in Brazil. Secondary objective is identifying risk factors for survival and relapse.
Patients and methods
We analyzed retrospectively from charts and database data from 141 patients with the diagnosis of MF who received allo-SCT at six centers in Brazil from 1997 to 2020. Patients and Transplant characteristics are disposed on Table 1. Statistical analysis was performed using EZR software. Bivariate analysis and estimation of OS and DFS were performed using Log Rank and Kaplan Meier method. A landmark analysis of survival was performed for acute (100 days) and chronic (180 days) GVHD. Cox Survival Model was used for multivariate analysis of survival and Multivariable Fine-Gray competing risks regression model was used or relapse/rejection at 2 years and non-relapse mortality at one year. Characteristics of patients are showed in table 1.
Results
Overall Survival (OS) for the whole cohort was 61% at one year, 56% at 2 years and 46% at 5 years. The transplant related mortality at 100 days and at one year was 14 and 26%, respectively. One- and two-year cumulative incidence of relapse or rejection was 10 % and 15% respectively. Cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (competitive risk) at one and two years was 33% and 37% respectively. At multivariate analysis by Cox Model, CD 34 > 5 x 106 HR 0.4405 (0.2396- 0.8101; p = 0.008) was associated to better survival, while KPS < 80% HR 2.3010 (1.01-5.19; p = 0.044) and DIPSS intermediate 2 or high-risk HR 5.7490 (2.33-14.18; p = 0.0001) were significantly associated with inferior survival. At Multivariable Fine-Gray competing risks regression model for relapse/rejection, previous therapy with ruxolitinib was identified as a risk factor HR 3.245(1.427- 7.379; p = 0.005), but there were only ten events in this group. At Multivariable Fine-Gray competing risks regression model for non-relapse mortality, KPS < 80% HR 3.2380(1.3030-8.046; p = 0.011) and DIPSS Intermediate 2-High risk were identified as independent risk factors -HR 8.8760 (1.9280 -40.870; p = 0.00510). At landmark analysis development of acute GVHD stage 3-4 was a significant risk factor for survival (0.00194).
Conclusions
1) DIPSS score was validated in this Brazilian cohort as a tool to estimate survival and non-relapse mortality after transplant, in agreement with international experience; 2) CD34 dose < 5 x 106 and Karnofsky score < 80% were significant risk factors for survival; 3) Karnofsky score < 80% and Intermediate-2 or High risk DIPSS were also significant risk factors for non-relapse mortality.}

abstract = {Ransomware is a form of malicious software which when deployed encrypts or locks the files and demands a ransom to have the files decrypted and accessible. In today’s digital world, devices connected to the network are vulnerable to ransomwares. Signature based methods are used to detect known ransomwares at an early stage to minimize the damage. This type of detection involves a predefined repository of static signatures which block the ransomwares based on the signatures in the repository. Fuzzy hashing method and Clam Av method for signature based ransomware detection have been proposed in literature. However, these methods raised false negatives and false positives respectively. Also, the speed of comparison in fuzzy hashing method was a limitation. In this paper an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based approach for filtering ransomwares by matching the incoming signature hash value with the signature database is proposed. Termed Ant Colony Optimization based Light weight Binary Search for Signature based Ransomware detection (ACOLBSR) algorithm, the ant agent finds the search space in the signature database. If a search space does not exist in the signature database, the incoming file is logged. If the search space exists in the database, the ant agent employs a binary search to match the incoming signature hash value with the signatures in the search space. If a match is found, the file is accepted or blocked if it is a goodware or ransomware respectively. If the incoming signature does not match with the signatures in the search space, the file is logged. The advantage of ACOLBSR algorithm is that the ransomwares are strictly filtered based on the signatures in the database. The computational complexity of ACOLBSR algorithm is less compared to binary search and sequential search. Also, it is shown that ACOLBSR algorithm do not generate false positives when compared to ClamAV, SplitScreen, fuzzy hashing and classification based approaches. Experimental results comparing the performance of the ACOLBSR scheme with the binary search scheme, sequential search scheme and classification based approaches are presented.}

abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate the best-corrected visual acuity and stereoacuity gains in children >7 years of age and adults with unilateral amblyopia treated with a prototype virtual reality–based binocular amblyopia therapy.
Methods
In this randomized, double masked, cross-in clinical trial, patients at Boston Children's Hospital with unilateral anisometropic and/or strabismic amblyopia and history of prior amblyopia treatment failure were randomized to either a full-treatment group (8 weeks of binocular treatment using therapeutic software application in virtual reality headset) or a sham-crossover group (4 weeks of sham treatment followed by 4 weeks of binocular treatment). Amblyopic eye visual acuity and stereoacuity were evaluated at 4, 8, and 16 weeks’ follow-up.
Results
The study cohort included 20 participants (10 females), with a median age of 9 years (range, 7-38 years). In the full-treatment group (11 patients), the mean amblyopic eye logMAR visual acuity at 16 weeks was 0.49 ± 0.26, compared with 0.47 ± 0.20 at baseline. In the sham-crossover group, it was 0.51 ± 0.18 at 16 weeks, compared with 0.53 ± 0.21 at baseline. Stereoacuity (log arcsec) was significantly improved, from 7.3 ± 2 at baseline to 6.6 ± 2.3 at 8 weeks (P < 0.001) and 6.7 ± 2.6 at 16 weeks (P < 0.001). No significant adverse events (diplopia, asthenopia, or worsening strabismus) were noted in either group.
Conclusions
Although the virtual reality-based prototype for binocular amblyopia therapy did not significantly improve visual acuity in the amblyopic eyes of older children and adults, stereoacuity did significantly improve compared with baseline; improvements were clinically minute. However, larger studies are required to confirm the results.}

abstract = {Introduction and objectives
Myocardial strain analysis could provide additional information to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDC). Our aim was to analyze the feasibility of left ventricular strain evaluation using cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking (FT) in NIDC, and to determine its clinical and prognostic impact.
Methods
We retrospectively included consecutive patients with NIDC who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance. Left ventricular global longitudinal, circumferential and radial strain were obtained from standard cine sequences using FT analysis software. We evaluated their association with a composite endpoint (heart failure, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in secondary prevention, or death).
Results
FT analysis could be performed in all of the 98 patients (mean age 68±13 years, 72% men). Intra- and interobserver concordance was good for global longitudinal and circumferential strain but was worse for radial strain. Global circumferential strain was independently associated (OR, 1.16; P=.045) with LVEF normalization during follow-up and was the only morphological parameter independently associated with the composite endpoint (OR, 1.15; P=.038). A cutoff value <−8.2% was able to predict the incidence of this event during follow-up (log-rank 4.6; P=.032).
Conclusions
Left ventricular strain analysis with FT is feasible and reproducible in NIDC. Global circumferential strain was able to predict LVEF recovery and the appearance of major cardiovascular events during follow-up.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
El análisis de la deformación miocárdica puede aportar información adicional a la fracción de eyección del ventrículo izquierdo (FEVI) en la miocardiopatía dilatada no isquémica (MDNI). El objetivo es analizar la factibilidad del estudio del strain del ventrículo izquierdo mediante feature tracking (FT) de cardiorresonancia magnética en la MDNI y determinar su relevancia clínica y pronóstica.
Métodos
Se incluyó retrospectivamente a los pacientes consecutivos con MDNI sometidos a cardiorresonancia magnética. Se obtuvieron el strain global longitudinal, circunferencial y radial del ventrículo izquierdo de secuencias convencionales de cine mediante un software de análisis de FT. Se evaluó su asociación con el evento combinado (insuficiencia cardiaca, implante de desfibrilador en prevención secundaria y muerte).
Resultados
Se pudo realizar el FT en los 98 pacientes evaluados (edad, 68± 13 años; el 72% varones). La concordancia intraobservador e interobservadores fue buena para el strain global longitudinal y circunferencial, y más limitada para el radial. El strain global circunferencial se asoció de manera independiente (OR=1,16; p=0,045) con la normalización de la FEVI en el seguimiento y fue el único parámetro morfológico con asociación independiente (OR=1,15; p=0,038) con el evento combinado. Un valor <–8,2% fue capaz de predecir la aparición de este evento en el seguimiento (Log-rank test, 4,6; p=0,032)
Conclusiones
El análisis del strain del ventrículo izquierdo mediante FT es factible y reproducible en MDNI. El strain global circunferencial fue capaz de predecir la recuperación de la FEVI y la aparición de eventos cardiovasculares mayores en el seguimiento.}
